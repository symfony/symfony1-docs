Chapter 1 - Form Creation
=========================

A form is made of fields like hidden inputs, text inputs, select boxes, and checkboxes. This chapter introduces you to creating forms and managing form fields using the symfony forms framework.

Symfony 1.1 is required to follow the chapters of this book. You will also need to create a project and a `frontend` application to keep going. Please refer to the introduction for more information on symfony project creation.

Before we start
---------------

We will begin by adding a contact form to a symfony application.

Figure 1-1 shows the contact form as seen by users who want to send a message.

Figure 1-1 - Contact form

![Contact form](/images/forms_book/en/01_01.png "Contact form")

We will create three fields for this form: the name of the user, the email of the user, and the message the user wants to send. We will simply display the information submitted in the form for the purpose of this exercise as shown in Figure 1-2.

Widgets
-------

### `sfForm` and `sfWidget` Classes

Users input information into fields which make up forms. In symfony, a form is an object inheriting from the `sfForm` class. In our example, we will create a `ContactForm` class inheriting from the `sfForm` class.

>**Note**
>`sfForm` is the base class of all forms and makes it easy to manage the configuration and life cycle of your forms.

You can start configuring your form by adding **widgets** using the `configure()` method.

A **widget** represents a form field. For our form example, we need to add three widgets representing our three fields: `name`, `email`, and `message`. Listing 1-1 shows the first implementation of the `ContactForm` class.

Listing 1-1 - `ContactForm` class with three fields

    [php]
    // lib/form/ContactForm.class.php
    class ContactForm extends BaseForm
    {
      public function configure()
      {
        $this->setWidgets(array(
          'name'    => new sfWidgetFormInputText(),
          'email'   => new sfWidgetFormInputText(),
          'message' => new sfWidgetFormTextarea(),
        ));
      }
    }

>**NOTE**
>In this book, we never show the opening `<?php` statement in the code
>examples that only contain pure PHP code to optimize space and save
>some trees. You should obviously remember to add it whenever you create
>a new PHP file.

The widgets are defined in the `configure()` method. This method is automatically called by the `sfForm` class constructor.

The `setWidgets()` method is used to define the widgets used in the form. The `setWidgets()` method accepts an associative array where the keys are the field names and the values are the widget objects. Each widget is an object inheriting from the `sfWidget` class. For this example we used two types of widgets:

  * `sfWidgetFormInput`  : This widget represents the `input` field
  * `sfWidgetFormTextarea`: This widget represents the `textarea` field

>**Note**
>As a convention, we store the form classes in a `lib/form/` directory. You can store them in any directory managed by the symfony autoloading mechanism but as we will see later, symfony uses the `lib/form/` directory to generate forms from model objects.

### Displaying the Form

Our form is now ready to be used. We can now create a symfony module to display the form:

    $ cd ~/PATH/TO/THE/PROJECT
    $ php symfony generate:module frontend contact

In the `contact` module, let's modify the `index` action to pass a form instance to the template as shown in Listing 1-2.

Listing 1-2 - Actions class from the `contact` Module

    [php]
    // apps/frontend/modules/contact/actions/actions.class.php
    class contactActions extends sfActions
    {
      public function executeIndex()
      {
        $this->form = new ContactForm();
      }
    }

When creating a form, the `configure()` method, defined earlier, will be called automatically.

We just need to create a template now to display the form as shown in Listing 1-3.

Listing 1-3 - Template displaying the form

    [php]
    // apps/frontend/modules/contact/templates/indexSuccess.php
    <form action="<?php echo url_for('contact/submit') ?>" method="POST">
      <table>
        <?php echo $form ?>
        <tr>
          <td colspan="2">
            <input type="submit" />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </form>

A symfony form only handles widgets displaying information to users. In the `indexSuccess` template, the `<?php echo $form ?>` line only displays three fields. The other elements such as the `form` tag and the submit button will need to be added by the developer. This might not look obvious at first, but we will see later how useful and easy it is to embed forms.

Using the construction `<?php echo $form ?>` is very useful when creating prototypes and defining forms. It allows developers to concentrate on the business logic without worrying about visual aspects. Chapter three will explain how to personalize the template and form layout.

>**Note**
When displaying an object using the `<?php echo $form ?>`, the PHP engine will actually display the text representation of the `$form` object. To convert the object into a string, PHP tries to execute the magic method `__toString()`. Each widget implements this magic method to convert the object into HTML code. Calling `<?php echo $form ?>` is then equivalent to calling `<?php echo $form->__toString() ?>`.

We can now see the form in a browser (Figure 1-4) and check the result by typing the address of the action `contact/index` (`/frontend_dev.php/contact`).

Figure 1-4 - Generated Contact Form

![Generated Contact Form](/images/forms_book/en/01_04.png "Generated Contact Form")

Listing 1-4 Shows the generated code by the template.

    [html]
    <form action="/frontend_dev.php/contact/submit" method="POST">
      <table>
        
        <!-- Beginning of generated code by <?php echo $form ?> -->
        <tr>
          <th><label for="name">Name</label></th>
          <td><input type="text" name="name" id="name" /></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th><label for="email">Email</label></th>
          <td><input type="text" name="email" id="email" /></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th><label for="message">Message</label></th>
          <td><textarea rows="4" cols="30" name="message" id="message"></textarea></td>
        </tr>
        <!-- End of generated code by <?php echo $form ?> -->

        <tr>
          <td colspan="2">
            <input type="submit" />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </form>

We can see that the form is displayed with three `<tr>` lines of an HTML table. That is why we had to enclose it in a `<table>` tag. Each line includes a `<label>` tag and a form tag (`<input>` or `<textarea>`).

### Labels

The labels of each field are automatically generated. By default, labels
are a transformation of the field name following the two following rules:
a capital first letter and underscores replaced by spaces. 
If the field's name ends with "_id", the suffix is removed from label.

Example:

    [php]
    $this->setWidgets(array(
      'first_name' => new sfWidgetFormInputText(), // generated label: "First name"
      'last_name'  => new sfWidgetFormInputText(), // generated label: "Last name"
      'author_id'  => new sfWidgetFormInputText(), // generated label: "Author"
    ));
 
Even if the automatic generation of labels is very useful, the framework allows you to define personalized labels with the `setLabels()` method :

    [php]
    $this->widgetSchema->setLabels(array(
      'name'    => 'Your name',
      'email'   => 'Your email address',
      'message' => 'Your message',
    ));

You can also only modify a single label using the `setLabel()` method:

    [php]
    $this->widgetSchema->setLabel('email', 'Your email address');

Finally, we will see in Chapter three that you can extend labels from the template to further customize the form.

>**Sidebar**
>Widget Schema
>
>When we use the `setWidgets()` method, symfony creates a `sfWidgetFormSchema` object. This object is a widget that allows you to represent a set of widgets. In our `ContactForm` form, we called the method `setWidgets()`. It is equivalent to the following code:
>
>     [php]
>     $this->setWidgetSchema(new sfWidgetFormSchema(array(
>       'name'    => new sfWidgetFormInputText(),
>       'email'   => new sfWidgetFormInputText(),
>       'message' => new sfWidgetFormTextarea(),
>     )));
>
>     // almost equivalent to :
>
>     $this->widgetSchema = new sfWidgetFormSchema(array(
>       'name'    => new sfWidgetFormInputText(),
>       'email'   => new sfWidgetFormInputText(),
>       'message' => new sfWidgetFormTextarea(),
>     ));
>
>The `setLabels()` method is applied to a collection of widgets included in the `widgetSchema` object .
>
>We will see in the Chapter 5 that the "schema widget" notion makes it easier to manage embedded forms.

### Beyond generated tables

Even if the form display is an HTML table by default, the layout format can be changed. These different types of layout formats are defined in classes inheriting from `sfWidgetFormSchemaFormatter`. By default, a form uses the `table` format as defined in the `sfWidgetFormSchemaFormatterTable` class. You can also use the `list` format:

    [php]
    class ContactForm extends BaseForm
    {
      public function configure()
      {
        $this->setWidgets(array(
          'name'    => new sfWidgetFormInputText(),
          'email'   => new sfWidgetFormInputText(),
          'message' => new sfWidgetFormTextarea(),
        ));

        $this->widgetSchema->setFormFormatterName('list');
      }
    }

Those two formats come by default and we will see in Chapter 5 how to create your own format classes. Now that we know how to display a form, let's see how to manage the submission.

### Submitting the Form

When we created a template to display a form, we used the internal URL `contact/submit` in the `form` tag to submit the form. We now need to add the `submit` action in the `contact` module. Listing 1-5 shows how an action can get the information from the user and redirect to the `thank you` page where we just display this information back to the user.

Listing 1-5 - Use of the `submit` action in the `contact` module

    [php]
    public function executeSubmit($request)
    {
      $this->forward404Unless($request->isMethod('post'));

      $params = array(
        'name'    => $request->getParameter('name'),
        'email'   => $request->getParameter('email'),
        'message' => $request->getParameter('message'),
      );

      $this->redirect('contact/thankyou?'.http_build_query($params));
    }

    public function executeThankyou()
    {
    }

    // apps/frontend/modules/contact/templates/thankyouSuccess.php
    <ul>
      <li>Name:    <?php echo $sf_params->get('name') ?></li>
      <li>Email:   <?php echo $sf_params->get('email') ?></li>
      <li>Message: <?php echo $sf_params->get('message') ?></li>
    </ul>

>**Note**
>`http_build_query` is a built-in PHP function that generates a URL-encoded query string from an array of parameters.

`executeSubmit()` method executes three actions:

  * For security reasons, we check that the page has been submitted using the HTTP method `POST`. If not sent using the `POST` method then the user is redirected to a 404 page. In the `indexSuccess` template, we declared the submit method as `POST` (`<form ... method="POST">`):

        [php]
        $this->forward404Unless($request->isMethod('post'));

  * Next we get the values from the user input to store them in the `params` table:

        [php]
        $params = array(
          'name'    => $request->getParameter('name'),
          'email'   => $request->getParameter('email'),
          'message' => $request->getParameter('message'),
        );

  * Finally, we redirect the user to a Thank you page  (`contact/thankyou`) to display his information:

        [php]
        $this->redirect('contact/thankyou?'.http_build_query($params));

Instead of redirecting the user to another page, we could have created a `submitSuccess.php` template. While it is possible, it is better practice to always redirect the user after a request with the `POST` method:

  * This prevents the form from being submitted again if the user reloads the Thank you page.

  * The user can also click on the back button without getting the pop-up to submit the form again.

>**Tip**
>You might have noticed that `executeSubmit()` is different from `executeIndex()`. When calling these methods symfony passes the current `sfRequest` object as the first argument to the `executeXXX()` methods. With PHP, you do not have to collect all parameters, that is why we did not define the `request` variable in `executeIndex()` since we do not need it.

Figure 1-5 shows the workflow of methods when interacting with the user.

Figure 1-5 - Methods workflow

![Methods workflow](/images/forms_book/en/01_05.png "Methods workflow")

>**Note**
>When redisplaying the user input in the template, we run the risk of a XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack. You can find further information on how to prevent the XSS risk by implementing an escaping strategy in the [Inside the View Layer](http://www.symfony-project.org/book/1_2/07-Inside-the-View-Layer#chapter_07_output_escaping) chapter of "The Definitive Guide to symfony" book.

After you submit the form you should now see the page from Figure 1-6.

Figure 1-6 - Page displayed after submitting the form

![Page displayed after submitting the form](/images/forms_book/en/01_06.png "Page displayed after submitting the form")

Instead of creating the `params` array, it would be easier to get the information from the user directly in an array. Listing 1-6 modifies the `name` HTML attribute from widgets to store the field values in the `contact` array.

Listing 1-6 - Modification of the `name` HTML attribute from widgets

    [php]
    class ContactForm extends BaseForm
    {
      public function configure()
      {
        $this->setWidgets(array(
          'name'    => new sfWidgetFormInputText(),
          'email'   => new sfWidgetFormInputText(),
          'message' => new sfWidgetFormTextarea(),
        ));

        $this->widgetSchema->setNameFormat('contact[%s]');
      }
    }

Calling `setNameFormat()` allows us to modify the `name` HTML attribute for all widgets. `%s` will automatically be replaced by the name of the field when generating the form. For example, the `name` attribute will then be `contact[email]` for the `email` field. PHP automatically creates an array with the values of a request including a `contact[email]` format. This way the field values will be available in the `contact` array.

We can now directly get the `contact` array from the `request` object as shown in Listing 1-7.

Listing 1-7 - New format of the `name` attributes in the action widgets

    [php]
    public function executeSubmit($request)
    {
      $this->forward404Unless($request->isMethod('post'));

      $this->redirect('contact/thankyou?'.http_build_query($request->getParameter('contact')));
    }

When displaying the HTML source of the form, you can see that symfony has generated a `name` attribute depending not only on the field name and format, but also an `id` attribute. The `id` attribute is automatically created from the `name` attribute by replacing the forbidden characters by underscores (`_`):

  | **Name**  | **Attribute `name`** | **Attribute `id`**  |
  | --------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
  | name      | contact[name]        | contact_name        |
  | email     | contact[email]       | contact_email       |
  | message   | contact[message]     | contact_message     |

### Another solution

In this example, we used two actions to manage the form: `index` for the display, `submit` for the submit. Since the form is displayed with the `GET` method and submitted with the `POST` method, we can also merge the two methods in the `index` method as shown in Listing 1-8.

Listing 1-8 - Merging of the two actions used in the form

    [php]
    class contactActions extends sfActions
    {
      public function executeIndex($request)
      {
        $this->form = new ContactForm();

        if ($request->isMethod('post'))
        {
          $this->redirect('contact/thankyou?'.http_build_query($request->getParameter('contact')));
        }
      }
    }

You also need to change the form `action` attribute in the `indexSuccess.php` template:

    [php]
    <form action="<?php echo url_for('contact/index') ?>" method="POST">

As we will see later, we prefer to use this syntax since it is shorter and makes the code more coherent and understandable.

Configuring the Widgets
-----------------------

### Widgets options

If a website is managed by several webmasters, we would certainly like to add a drop-down list with themes in order to redirect the message according to what is asked (Figure 1-7). Listing 1-9 adds a `subject` with a drop-down list using the `sfWidgetFormSelect` widget.

Figure 1-7 - Adding a `subject` Field to the Form

![Adding a `subject` Field to the Form](/images/forms_book/en/01_07.png "Adding a `subject` Field to the Form")

Listing 1-9 - Adding a `subject` Field to the Form

    [php]
    class ContactForm extends BaseForm
    {
      protected static $subjects = array('Subject A', 'Subject B', 'Subject C');

      public function configure()
      {
        $this->setWidgets(array(
          'name'    => new sfWidgetFormInputText(),
          'email'   => new sfWidgetFormInputText(),
          'subject' => new sfWidgetFormSelect(array('choices' => self::$subjects)),
          'message' => new sfWidgetFormTextarea(),
        ));

        $this->widgetSchema->setNameFormat('contact[%s]');
      }
    }

>**SIDEBAR**
>The `choices` option of the `sfWidgetFormSelect` Widget
>
>PHP does not make any distinction between an array and an associative array, so the array we used for the subject list is identical to the following code:
>
>     [php]
>     $subjects = array(0 => 'Subject A', 1 => 'Subject B', 2 => 'Subject C');
>
>The generated widget takes the array key as the `value` attribute of the `option` tag, and the related value as content of the tag:
>
>     [php]
>     <select name="contact[subject]" id="contact_subject">
>       <option value="0">Subject A</option>
>       <option value="1">Subject B</option>
>       <option value="2">Subject C</option>
>     </select>
>
>In order to change the `value` attributes, we just have to define the array keys:
>
>     [php]
>     $subjects = array('A' => 'Subject A', 'B' => 'Subject B', 'C' => 'Subject C');
>
>Which generates the HTML template:
>
>     [php]
>     <select name="contact[subject]" id="contact_subject">
>       <option value="A">Subject A</option>
>       <option value="B">Subject B</option>
>       <option value="C">Subject C</option>
>     </select>

The `sfWidgetFormSelect` widget, like all widgets, takes a list of options as the first argument. An option may be mandatory or optional. The `sfWidgetFormSelect` widget has a mandatory option, `choices`. Here are the available options for the widgets we already used:

  | **Widget**             | **Mandatory Options** | **Additional Options**           |
  | ---------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
  | `sfWidgetFormInput`    | -                     | `type` (default to `text`)       |
  |                        |                       | `is_hidden` (default to `false`) |
  | `sfWidgetFormSelect`   | `choices`             | `multiple` (default to `false`)  |
  | `sfWidgetFormTextarea` | -                     | -                                |

>**Tip**
>If you want to know all of the options for a widget, you can refer to the complete API documentation available online at  ([http://www.symfony-project.org/api/1_2/](http://www.symfony-project.org/api/1_2/)). All of the options are explained, as well as the additional options default values. For instance, all of the options for the `sfWidgetFormSelect` are available here: ([http://www.symfony-project.org/api/1_2/sfWidgetFormSelect](http://www.symfony-project.org/api/1_2/sfWidgetFormSelect)).

### The Widgets HTML Attributes

Each widget also takes a list of HTML attributes as second optional argument. This is very helpful to define default HTML attributes for the generated form tag. Listing 1-10 shows how to add a `class` attribute to the `email` field.

Listing 1-10 - Defining Attributes for a Widget

    [php]
    $emailWidget = new sfWidgetFormInputText(array(), array('class' => 'email'));

    // Generated HTML
    <input type="text" name="contact[email]" class="email" id="contact_email" />

HTML attributes also allow us to override the automatically generated identifier, as shown in Listing 1-11.

Listing 1-11 - Overriding the `id` Attribute

    [php]
    $emailWidget = new sfWidgetFormInputText(array(), array('class' => 'email', 'id' => 'email'));

    // Generated HTML
    <input type="text" name="contact[email]" class="email" id="email" />

It is even possible to set default values to the fields using the `value` attribute as Listing 1-12 shows.

Listing 1-12 - Widgets Default Values via HTML Attributes

    [php]
    $emailWidget = new sfWidgetFormInputText(array(), array('value' => 'Your Email Here'));

    // Generated HTML
    <input type="text" name="contact[email]" value="Your Email Here" id="contact_email" />

This option works for `input` widgets, but is hard to carry through with `checkbox` or `radio` widgets, and even impossible with a `textarea` widget. The `sfForm` class offers specific methods to define default values for each field in a uniform way for any type of widget.


>**Note**
>We recommend to define HTML attributes inside the template and not in the form itself (even if it is possible) to preserve the layers of separation as we will see in Chapter three.

### Defining Default Values For Fields

It is often useful to define a default value for each field. For instance, when we display a help message in the field that disappears when the user focuses on the field. Listing 1-13 shows how to define default values via the `setDefault()` and `setDefaults()` methods.

Listing 1-13 - Default Values of the Widgets via the `setDefault()` and `setDefaults()` Methods

    [php]
    class ContactForm extends BaseForm
    {
      public function configure()
      {
        // ...

        $this->setDefault('email', 'Your Email Here');

        $this->setDefaults(array('email' => 'Your Email Here', 'name' => 'Your Name Here'));
      }
    }

The `setDefault()` and `setDefaults()` methods are very helpful to define 
identical default values for every instance of the same form class. If we
want to modify an existing object using a form, the default values will 
depend on the instance, therefore they must be dynamic. Listing 1-14 shows
the `sfForm` constructor has a first argument that sets default values 
dynamically.

Listing 1-14 - Default Values of the Widgets via the Constructor of `sfForm`

    [php]
    public function executeIndex($request)
    {
      $this->form = new ContactForm(array('email' => 'Your Email Here', 'name' => 'Your Name Here'));

      // ...
    }

>**SIDEBAR**
>Protection XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
>
>When setting HTML attributes for widgets, or defining default values, the `sfForm` class automatically protects these values against XSS attacks during the generation of the HTML code. This protection does not depend on the `escaping_strategy` configuration of the `settings.yml` file. If a content has already been protected by another method, the protection will not be applied again.
>
>It also protects the `'` and `"` characters that might invalidate the generated HTML.
>
>Here is an example of this protection:
>
>     [php]
>     $emailWidget = new sfWidgetFormInputText(array(), array(
>       'value' => 'Hello "World!"',
>       'class' => '<script>alert("foo")</script>',
>     ));
>     
>     // Generated HTML
>     <input
>       value="Hello &quot;World!&quot;"
>       class="&lt;script&gt;alert(&quot;foo&quot;)&lt;/script&gt;"
>       type="text" name="contact[email]" id="contact_email"
>     />
