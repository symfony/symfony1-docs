Day 5: The Routing
==================

If you've completed day 4, you should now be familiar with the MVC pattern and
it should be feeling like a more and more natural way of coding. Spend a bit
more time with it and you won't look back. To practice a bit yesterday, we
customized the Jobeet pages and in the process, also reviewed several symfony
concepts, like the layout, helpers, and slots.

Today we will dive into the wonderful world of the symfony routing framework.

~URL~s
------

If you click on a job on the Jobeet homepage, the URL looks like this:
`/job/show/id/1`. If you have already developed PHP websites, you are probably
more accustomed to URLs like `/job.php?id=1`. How does symfony make it work?
How does symfony determine the action to call based on this URL? Why is the
`id` of the job retrieved with `$request->getParameter('id')`? Today, we will
answer all these questions.

But first, let's talk about URLs and what exactly they are. In a web context,
a URL is the unique identifier of a web resource. When you go to a URL, you
ask the browser to fetch a resource identified by that URL. So, as the URL is
the interface between the website and the user, it must convey some meaningful
information about the resource it references. But "traditional" URLs do not
really describe the resource, they expose the internal structure of the
application. The user does not care that your website is developed with the
PHP language or that the job has a certain identifier in the database.
Exposing the internal workings of your application is also quite bad as far as
~security|Security~ is concerned: What if the user tries to guess the URL for
resources he does not have access to? Sure, the developer must secure them the
proper way, but you'd better hide sensitive information.

URLs are so important in symfony that it has an entire framework dedicated to
their management: the **~routing|Routing~** framework. The routing manages
internal URIs and external URLs. When a request comes in, the routing parses
the URL and converts it to an internal URI.

You have already seen the internal URI of the job page in the
`showSuccess.php` template:

    'job/show?id='.$job->getId()

The ~`url_for()` helper~ converts this internal URI to a proper URL:

    /job/show/id/1

The internal URI is made of several parts: `job` is the module, `show` is the
action and the query string adds parameters to pass to the action. The
generic pattern for internal URIs is:

    MODULE/ACTION?key=value&key_1=value_1&...

As the symfony routing is a two-way process, you can change the URLs without
changing the technical implementation. This is one of the main advantages of
the front-controller design pattern.

Routing Configuration
---------------------

The mapping between internal URIs and external URLs is done in the
~`routing.yml`~ configuration file:

    [yml]
    # apps/frontend/config/routing.yml
    homepage:
      url:   /
      param: { module: default, action: index }

    default_index:
      url:   /:module
      param: { action: index }

    default:
      url:   /:module/:action/*

The `routing.yml` file describes routes. A route has a name (`homepage`), a
pattern (`/:module/:action/*`), and some parameters (under the `param` key).

When a request comes in, the routing tries to match a pattern for the given
URL. The first route that matches wins, so the order in `routing.yml` is
important. Let's take a look at some examples to better understand how this
works.

When you request the Jobeet homepage, which has the `/job` URL, the first
route that matches is the `default_index` one. In a pattern, a word
~prefixed|Prefix~ with a colon (`:`) is a variable, so the `/:module` pattern
means: Match a `/` followed by something. In our example, the `module`
variable will have `job` as a value. This value can then be retrieved with
`$request->getParameter('module')` in the action. This route also defines a
default value for the `action` variable. So, for all URLs matching this route,
the request will also have an `action` parameter with `index` as a value.

If you request the `/job/show/id/1` page, symfony will match the last pattern:
`/:module/:action/*`. In a pattern, a star (`*`) matches a collection of
variable/value pairs separated by slashes (`/`):

  | Request parameter | Value |
  | ----------------- | ----- |
  | module            | job   |
  | action            | show  |
  | id                | 1     |

>**NOTE**
>The `~module|Module~` and `~action|Action~` variables are special as they are used by
>symfony to determine the action to execute.

The `/job/show/id/1` URL can be created from a template by using the following
call to the `url_for()` helper:

    [php]
    url_for('job/show?id='.$job->getId())

You can also use the route name by prefixing it by `@`:

    [php]
    url_for('@default?module=job&action=show&id='.$job->getId())

Both calls are equivalent but the latter is much faster as the routing does
not have to parse all routes to find the best match, and it is less tied to
the implementation (the module and action names are not present in the
internal URI).

Route Customizations
--------------------

For now, when you request the `/` URL in a browser, you have the default
congratulations page of symfony. That's because this URL matches the
`homepage` ~route|Route~. But it makes sense to change it to be the Jobeet
homepage. To make the change, modify the `module` variable of the `homepage`
route to `job`:

    [php]
    # apps/frontend/config/routing.yml
    homepage:
      url:   /
      param: { module: job, action: index }

We can now change the link of the Jobeet logo in the layout to use the
`homepage` route:

    [php]
    <!-- apps/frontend/templates/layout.php -->
    <h1>
      <a href="<?php echo url_for('@homepage') ?>">
        <img src="/images/logo.jpg" alt="Jobeet Job Board" />
      </a>
    </h1>

That was easy!

>**TIP**
>When you update the routing configuration, the changes are immediately
>taken into account in the development environment. But to make them
>also work in the production environment, you need to clear the cache by
>calling the `cache:clear` task.

For something a bit more involved, let's change the job page URL to something
more meaningful:

    /job/sensio-labs/paris-france/1/web-developer

Without knowing anything about Jobeet, and without looking at the page, you
can understand from the URL that Sensio Labs is looking for a Web developer to
work in Paris, France.

>**NOTE**
>Pretty URLs are important because they convey information for the user. It is
>also useful when you copy and paste the URL in an email or to optimize your
>website for search engines.

The following pattern matches such a URL:

    /job/:company/:location/:id/:position

Edit the `routing.yml` file and add the `job_show_user` route at the beginning
of the file:

    [yml]
    job_show_user:
      url:   /job/:company/:location/:id/:position
      param: { module: job, action: show }

If you refresh the Jobeet homepage, the links to jobs have not changed. That's
because to generate a route, you need to pass all the required variables. So,
you need to change the `url_for()` call in `indexSuccess.php` to:

    [php]
    url_for('job/show?id='.$job->getId().'&company='.$job->getCompany().
      '&location='.$job->getLocation().'&position='.$job->getPosition())

An ~internal URI|Internal URI~ can also be expressed as an array:

    [php]
    url_for(array(
      'module'   => 'job',
      'action'   => 'show',
      'id'       => $job->getId(),
      'company'  => $job->getCompany(),
      'location' => $job->getLocation(),
      'position' => $job->getPosition(),
    ))

Requirements
------------

During the first day tutorial, we talked about validation and error handling
for good reasons. The routing system has a built-in ~validation|Validation~
feature. Each pattern variable can be validated by a regular expression
defined using the `~requirements|Requirements~` entry of a ~route|Route~
definition:

    [yml]
    job_show_user:
      url:   /job/:company/:location/:id/:position
      param: { module: job, action: show }
      requirements:
        id: \d+

The above `requirements` entry forces the `id` to be a numeric value. If not,
the route won't match.

Route Class
-----------

Each route defined in ~`routing.yml`~ is internally converted to an object of
class [`sfRoute`](http://www.symfony-project.org/api/1_4/sfRoute). This class
can be changed by defining a `class` entry in the route definition. If you are
familiar with the ~HTTP~ protocol, you know that it defines several "methods",
like `~GET|GET (HTTP Method)~`, `~POST|POST (HTTP Method)~`, `~HEAD|HEAD (HTTP
Method)~`, `~DELETE|DELETE (HTTP Method)~`, and `~PUT|PUT (HTTP Method)~`. The
first three are supported by all browsers, while the other two are not.

To restrict a route to only match for certain request methods, you can change
the route class to
[`sfRequestRoute`](http://www.symfony-project.org/api/1_4/sfRequestRoute) and
add a requirement for the virtual `sf_method` variable:

    [yml]
    job_show_user:
      url:   /job/:company/:location/:id/:position
      class: sfRequestRoute
      param: { module: job, action: show }
      requirements:
        id: \d+
        sf_method: [get]

>**NOTE**
>Requiring a route to only match for some ~HTTP methods|HTTP Method~ is not
>totally equivalent to using `sfWebRequest::isMethod()` in your actions.
>That's because the routing will continue to look for a matching route if the
>method does not match the expected one.

Object Route Class
------------------

The new internal URI for a job is quite long and tedious to write
(`url_for('job/show?id='.$job->getId().'&company='.$job->getCompany().'&location='.$job->getLocation().'&position='.$job->getPosition())`),
but as we have just learned in the previous section, the route class can be
changed. For the `job_show_user` route, it is better to use
[~`sfPropelRoute`~](http://www.symfony-project.org/api/1_4/sfPropelRoute) as
the class is optimized for routes that represent ##ORM## objects or
collections of ##ORM## objects:

    [yml]
    job_show_user:
      url:     /job/:company/:location/:id/:position
      class:   sfPropelRoute
      options: { model: JobeetJob, type: object }
      param:   { module: job, action: show }
      requirements:
        id: \d+
        sf_method: [get]

The `options` entry customizes the behavior of the route. Here, the `model`
option defines the ##ORM## model class (`JobeetJob`) related to the route, and
the `type` option defines that this route is tied to one object (you can also
use `list` if a route represents a collection of objects).

The `job_show_user` route is now aware of its relation with `JobeetJob` and so
we can simplify the ~`url_for()`|`url_for()` helper~ call to:

    [php]
    url_for(array('sf_route' => 'job_show_user', 'sf_subject' => $job))

or just:

    [php]
    url_for('job_show_user', $job)

>**NOTE**
>The first example is useful when you need to pass more arguments than just
>the object.

It works because all variables in the route have a corresponding accessor in
the `JobeetJob` class (for instance, the `company` route variable is replaced
with the value of `getCompany()`).

If you have a look at generated URLs, they are not quite yet as we want them
to be:

    http://jobeet.localhost/frontend_dev.php/job/Sensio+Labs/Paris%2C+France/1/Web+Developer

We need to "~slug|Slug~ify" the column values by replacing all non ASCII
characters by a `-`. Open the `JobeetJob` file and add the following methods
to the class:

    [php]
<propel>
    // lib/model/JobeetJob.php
</propel>
<doctrine>
    // lib/model/doctrine/JobeetJob.class.php
</doctrine>
    public function getCompanySlug()
    {
      return Jobeet::slugify($this->getCompany());
    }

    public function getPositionSlug()
    {
      return Jobeet::slugify($this->getPosition());
    }

    public function getLocationSlug()
    {
      return Jobeet::slugify($this->getLocation());
    }

Then, create the `lib/Jobeet.class.php` file and add the `slugify` method in
it:

    [php]
    // lib/Jobeet.class.php
    class Jobeet
    {
      static public function slugify($text)
      {
        // replace all non letters or digits by -
        $text = preg_replace('/\W+/', '-', $text);

        // trim and lowercase
        $text = strtolower(trim($text, '-'));

        return $text;
      }
    }

>**NOTE**
>In this tutorial, we never show the opening `<?php` statement in the
>code examples that only contain pure PHP code to optimize space and
>save some trees. You should obviously remember to add it whenever you
>create a new PHP file. Just remember to not add it to template files.

We have defined three new "virtual" accessors: `getCompanySlug()`,
`getPositionSlug()`, and `getLocationSlug()`. They return their corresponding
column value after applying it the `slugify()` method. Now, you can replace
the real column names by these virtual ones in the `job_show_user` route:

    [yml]
    job_show_user:
      url:     /job/:company_slug/:location_slug/:id/:position_slug
      class:   sfPropelRoute
      options: { model: JobeetJob, type: object }
      param:   { module: job, action: show }
      requirements:
        id: \d+
        sf_method: [get]

You will now have the expected URLs:

    http://jobeet.localhost/frontend_dev.php/job/sensio-labs/paris-france/1/web-developer

But that's only half the story. The route is able to generate a URL based on
an object, but it is also able to find the object related to a given URL. The
related object can be retrieved with the `getObject()` method of the route
object. When parsing an incoming request, the routing stores the matching
route object for you to use in the actions. So, change the `executeShow()`
method to use the route object to retrieve the `Jobeet` object:

    [php]
    class jobActions extends sfActions
    {
      public function executeShow(sfWebRequest $request)
      {
        $this->job = $this->getRoute()->getObject();

        $this->forward404Unless($this->job);
      }

      // ...
    }

If you try to get a job for an unknown `id`, you will see a 404 error page but
the error message has changed:

![404 with sfPropelRoute](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_4/05/404_propel_route.png)

That's because the ~404|404 Error~ error has been thrown for you automatically
by the `getRoute()` method. So, we can simplify the `executeShow` method even
more:

    [php]
    class jobActions extends sfActions
    {
      public function executeShow(sfWebRequest $request)
      {
        $this->job = $this->getRoute()->getObject();
      }

      // ...
    }

>**TIP**
>If you don't want the route to generate a 404 error, you can set the
>`allow_empty` routing option to `true`.

-

>**NOTE**
>The related object of a route is lazy loaded. It is only retrieved from the
>database if you call the `getRoute()` method.

Routing in Actions and Templates
--------------------------------

In a template, the `url_for()` helper converts an internal URI to an external URL. Some
other symfony helpers also take an internal URI as an argument, like the
`~link_to()~` helper which generates an `<a>` tag:

    [php]
    <?php echo link_to($job->getPosition(), 'job_show_user', $job) ?>

It generates the following HTML code:

    [php]
    <a href="/job/sensio-labs/paris-france/1/web-developer">Web Developer</a>

Both `url_for()` and `link_to()` can also generate absolute URLs:

    [php]
    url_for('job_show_user', $job, true);

    link_to($job->getPosition(), 'job_show_user', $job, true);

If you want to generate a URL from an action, you can use the `generateUrl()`
method:

    [php]
    $this->redirect('job_show_user', $job);

>**SIDEBAR**
>The "~redirect|Redirection~" Methods Family
>
>In yesterday's tutorial, we talked about the "forward" methods. These methods
>forward the current request to another action without a round-trip with
>the browser.
>
>The "redirect" methods redirect the user to another URL. As with forward,
>you can use the `redirect()` method, or the `redirectIf()` and
>`redirectUnless()` shortcut methods.

Collection Route Class
----------------------

For the `job` module, we have already customized the `show` action route, but
the URLs for the others methods (`index`, `new`, `edit`, `create`, `update`,
and `delete`) are still managed by the `default` route:

    [yml]
    default:
      url: /:module/:action/*

The `default` route is a great way to start coding without defining too many
routes. But as the route acts as a "catch-all", it cannot be configured for
specific needs.

As all `job` actions are related to the `JobeetJob` model class, we can easily
define a custom ~`sfPropelRoute`~ route for each as we have already done for
the `show` action. But as the `job` module defines the classic seven actions
possible for a model, we can also use the
[~`sfPropelRouteCollection`~](http://www.symfony-project.org/api/1_4/sfPropelRouteCollection)
class. Open the `routing.yml` file and modify it to read as follows:

    [yml]
    # apps/frontend/config/routing.yml
    job:
      class:   sfPropelRouteCollection
      options: { model: JobeetJob }

    job_show_user:
      url:     /job/:company_slug/:location_slug/:id/:position_slug
      class:   sfPropelRoute
      options: { model: JobeetJob, type: object }
      param:   { module: job, action: show }
      requirements:
        id: \d+
        sf_method: [get]

    # default rules
    homepage:
      url:   /
      param: { module: job, action: index }

    default_index:
      url:   /:module
      param: { action: index }

    default:
      url:   /:module/:action/*

The `job` route above is really just a shortcut that automatically generate
the following seven `sfPropelRoute` routes:

    [yml]
    job:
      url:     /job.:sf_format
      class:   sfPropelRoute
      options: { model: JobeetJob, type: list }
      param:   { module: job, action: index, sf_format: html }
      requirements: { sf_method: get }

    job_new:
      url:     /job/new.:sf_format
      class:   sfPropelRoute
      options: { model: JobeetJob, type: object }
      param:   { module: job, action: new, sf_format: html }
      requirements: { sf_method: get }

    job_create:
      url:     /job.:sf_format
      class:   sfPropelRoute
      options: { model: JobeetJob, type: object }
      param:   { module: job, action: create, sf_format: html }
      requirements: { sf_method: post }

    job_edit:
      url:     /job/:id/edit.:sf_format
      class:   sfPropelRoute
      options: { model: JobeetJob, type: object }
      param:   { module: job, action: edit, sf_format: html }
      requirements: { sf_method: get }

    job_update:
      url:     /job/:id.:sf_format
      class:   sfPropelRoute
      options: { model: JobeetJob, type: object }
      param:   { module: job, action: update, sf_format: html }
      requirements: { sf_method: put }

    job_delete:
      url:     /job/:id.:sf_format
      class:   sfPropelRoute
      options: { model: JobeetJob, type: object }
      param:   { module: job, action: delete, sf_format: html }
      requirements: { sf_method: delete }

    job_show:
      url:     /job/:id.:sf_format
      class:   sfPropelRoute
      options: { model: JobeetJob, type: object }
      param:   { module: job, action: show, sf_format: html }
      requirements: { sf_method: get }

>**NOTE**
>Some routes generated by `sfPropelRouteCollection` have the same ~URL~. The
>routing is still able to use them because they all have different 
>~HTTP method|HTTP Method~ requirements.

The `job_delete` and `job_update` routes requires ~HTTP methods|HTTP Method~
that are not supported by browsers (`~DELETE|DELETE (HTTP Method)~` and
`~PUT|PUT (HTTP Method)~` respectively). This works because symfony simulates
them. Open the `_form.php` template to see an example:

    [php]
    // apps/frontend/modules/job/templates/_form.php
    <form action="..." ...>
    <?php if (!$form->getObject()->isNew()): ?>
      <input type="hidden" name="sf_method" value="PUT" />
    <?php endif; ?>

    <?php echo link_to(
      'Delete',
      'job/delete?id='.$form->getObject()->getId(),
      array('method' => 'delete', 'confirm' => 'Are you sure?')
    ) ?>

All the symfony helpers can be told to simulate whatever HTTP method you want
by passing the special `sf_method` parameter.

>**NOTE**
>symfony has other special parameters like `sf_method`, all starting with
>the `sf_` ~prefix|Prefix~. In the generated routes above, you can see another one:
>`sf_format`, which will be explained in a coming day.

Route Debugging
---------------

When you use collection routes, it is sometimes useful to list the generated
routes. The `app:routes` task outputs all the routes for a given application:

    $ php symfony app:routes frontend

You can also have a lot of ~debug|Debug~ging information for a route by passing its
name as an additional argument:

    $ php symfony app:routes frontend job_edit

Default Routes
--------------

It is a good practice to define ~route|Route~s for all your URLs. As the `job`
route defines all the routes needed to describe the Jobeet application, go
ahead and remove or comment the default routes from the `routing.yml`
configuration file:

    [yml]
    # apps/frontend/config/routing.yml
    #default_index:
    #  url:   /:module
    #  param: { action: index }
    #
    #default:
    #  url:   /:module/:action/*

The Jobeet application must still work as before.

Final Thoughts
--------------

This chapter was packed with a lot of new information. You have learned how to
use the routing framework of symfony and how to decouple your URLs from the technical
implementation.

In the following chapter, we won't introduce any new concept, but rather spend
time going deeper into what we've covered so far.

__ORM__
