Day 11: Testing your Forms
==========================

In chapter 10, we created our first form with symfony. People are now able to
post a new job on Jobeet but we ran out of time before we could add some tests.

That's what we will do along this chapter. Along the way, we will also learn more
about the form framework.

Submitting a Form
-----------------

Let's open the `jobActionsTest` file to add functional ~test|Testing~s for the
job creation and validation process.

At the end of the file, add the following code to get the job creation page:

    [php]
    // test/functional/frontend/jobActionsTest.php
    $browser->info('3 - Post a Job page')->
      info('  3.1 - Submit a Job')->

      get('/job/new')->
      with('request')->begin()->
        isParameter('module', 'job')->
        isParameter('action', 'new')->
      end()
    ;

We have already used the `click()` method to simulate clicks on links. The
same `click()` method can be used to submit a ~form|Forms~. For a form, you
can pass the values to submit for each field as a second argument of the
method. Like a real browser, the browser object will merge the default values
of the form with the submitted values.

But to pass the field values, we need to know their names. If you open the
source code or use the Firefox Web Developer Toolbar "Forms > Display Form
Details" feature, you will see that the name for the `company` field is
`jobeet_job[company]`.

>**NOTE**
>When PHP encounters an input field with a name like `jobeet_job[company]`, it
>automatically converts it to an array of name `jobeet_job`.

To make things look a bit more clean, let's change the format to `job[%s]` by
adding the following code at the end of the `configure()` method of
`JobeetJobForm`:

    [php]
<propel>
    // lib/form/JobeetJobForm.class.php
</propel>
<doctrine>
    // lib/form/doctrine/JobeetJobForm.class.php
</doctrine>
    $this->widgetSchema->setNameFormat('job[%s]');

After this change, the `company` name should be `job[company]` in your
browser. It is now time to actually click on the "Preview your job" button and
pass valid values to the form:

    [php]
    // test/functional/frontend/jobActionsTest.php
    $browser->info('3 - Post a Job page')->
      info('  3.1 - Submit a Job')->

      get('/job/new')->
      with('request')->begin()->
        isParameter('module', 'job')->
        isParameter('action', 'new')->
      end()->

      click('Preview your job', array('job' => array(
        'company'      => 'Sensio Labs',
        'url'          => 'http://www.sensio.com/',
        'logo'         => sfConfig::get('sf_upload_dir').'/jobs/sensio-labs.gif',
        'position'     => 'Developer',
        'location'     => 'Atlanta, USA',
        'description'  => 'You will work with symfony to develop websites for our customers.',
        'how_to_apply' => 'Send me an email',
        'email'        => 'for.a.job@example.com',
        'is_public'    => false,
      )))->

      with('request')->begin()->
        isParameter('module', 'job')->
        isParameter('action', 'create')->
      end()
    ;

The browser also simulates ~file uploads|File Upload~ if you pass the absolute
path to the file to upload.

After submitting the form, we checked that the executed action is `create`.

The Form Tester
---------------

The form we have submitted should be valid. You can test this by using the
**form tester**:

    [php]
    with('form')->begin()->
      hasErrors(false)->
    end()->

The form tester has several methods to test the current form status, like the
errors.

If you make a mistake in the test, and the test does not pass, you can use the
`with('response')->~debug|Debug~()` statement we have seen during day 9. But
you will have to dig into the generated HTML to check for error messages.
That's not really convenient. The form tester also provides a `debug()` method
that outputs the form status and all error messages associated with it:

    [php]
    with('form')->debug()

Redirection Test
----------------

As the form is valid, the job should have been created and the user
~redirected|Redirection (Test)~ to the `show` page:

    [php]
    with('response')->isRedirected()->
    followRedirect()->

    with('request')->begin()->
      isParameter('module', 'job')->
      isParameter('action', 'show')->
    end()->

The `isRedirected()` tests if the page has been redirected and the
`followRedirect()` method follows the redirect.

>**NOTE**
>The browser class does not follow redirects automatically as you might want
>to introspect objects before the redirection.

The ##ORM## Tester
-----------------

Eventually, we want to test that the job has been created in the database and
check that the `is_activated` column is set to `false` as the user has not
published it yet.

This can be done quite easily by using yet another ~tester|Testers~, the
**##ORM## tester**. As the ##ORM## tester is not registered by default, let's
add it now:

<propel>
    [php]
    $browser->setTester('propel', 'sfTesterPropel');
</propel>
<doctrine>
    [php]
    $browser->setTester('doctrine', 'sfTesterDoctrine');
</doctrine>

The ##ORM## tester provides the `check()` method to check that one or more
objects in the database match the criteria passed as an argument.

    [php]
<propel>
    with('propel')->begin()->
</propel>
<doctrine>
    with('doctrine')->begin()->
</doctrine>
      check('JobeetJob', array(
        'location'     => 'Atlanta, USA',
        'is_activated' => false,
        'is_public'    => false,
      ))->
    end()

<propel>
The criteria can be an array of values like above, or a `Criteria` instance
for more complex queries. You can test the existence of objects matching the
criteria with a Boolean as the third argument (the default is `true`), or the
number of matching objects by passing an integer.
</propel>
<doctrine>
The criteria can be an array of values like above, or a `Doctrine_Query` 
instance for more complex queries. You can test the existence of objects
matching the criteria with a Boolean as the third argument (the default is
`true`), or the number of matching objects by passing an integer.
</doctrine>

Testing for ~Errors~
--------------------

The job ~form|Forms~ creation works as expected when we submit valid values.
Let's add a test to check the behavior when we submit non-valid data:

    [php]
    $browser->
      info('  3.2 - Submit a Job with invalid values')->

      get('/job/new')->
      click('Preview your job', array('job' => array(
        'company'      => 'Sensio Labs',
        'position'     => 'Developer',
        'location'     => 'Atlanta, USA',
        'email'        => 'not.an.email',
      )))->

      with('form')->begin()->
        hasErrors(3)->
        isError('description', 'required')->
        isError('how_to_apply', 'required')->
        isError('email', 'invalid')->
      end()
    ;

The `hasErrors()` method can test the number of errors if passed an integer.
The `isError()` method tests the error code for a given field.

>**TIP**
>In the tests we have written for the non-valid data submission, we have not
>re-tested the entire form all over again. We have only added tests for
>specific things.

You can also test the generated ~HTML~ to check that it contains the error
messages, but it is not necessary in our case as we have not customized the
form layout.

Now, we need to test the admin bar found on the job preview page. When a job
has not been activated yet, you can edit, delete, or publish the job. To test
those three links, we will need to first create a job. But that's a lot of
copy and paste. As I don't like to waste e-trees, let's add a job creator
method in the `JobeetTestFunctional` class:

    [php]
    // lib/test/JobeetTestFunctional.class.php
    class JobeetTestFunctional extends sfTestFunctional
    {
      public function createJob($values = array())
      {
        return $this->
          get('/job/new')->
          click('Preview your job', array('job' => array_merge(array(
            'company'      => 'Sensio Labs',
            'url'          => 'http://www.sensio.com/',
            'position'     => 'Developer',
            'location'     => 'Atlanta, USA',
            'description'  => 'You will work with symfony to develop websites for our customers.',
            'how_to_apply' => 'Send me an email',
            'email'        => 'for.a.job@example.com',
            'is_public'    => false,
          ), $values)))->
          followRedirect()
        ;
      }

      // ...
    }

The `createJob()` method creates a job, follows the redirect and returns the
browser to not break the fluent interface. You can also pass an array of values
that will be merged with some default values.

Forcing the ~HTTP Method~ of a link
-----------------------------------

Testing the "Publish" link is now more simple:

    [php]
    $browser->info('  3.3 - On the preview page, you can publish the job')->
      createJob(array('position' => 'FOO1'))->
      click('Publish', array(), array('method' => 'put', '_with_csrf' => true))->

<propel>
      with('propel')->begin()->
</propel>
<doctrine>
      with('doctrine')->begin()->
</doctrine>
        check('JobeetJob', array(
          'position'     => 'FOO1',
          'is_activated' => true,
        ))->
      end()
    ;

If you remember from chapter 10, the "Publish" link has been configured to be
called with the HTTP `~PUT|PUT (HTTP Method)~` method. As browsers don't
understand `PUT` requests, the `link_to()` helper converts the link to a form
with some JavaScript. As the test browser does not execute JavaScript, we need
to force the method to `PUT` by passing it as a third option of the `click()`
method. Moreover, the `link_to()` helper also embeds a ~CSRF token~ as we have
enabled CSRF protection during chapter 1; the `_with_csrf` option simulates this
token.

Testing the "Delete" link is quite similar:

    [php]
    $browser->info('  3.4 - On the preview page, you can delete the job')->
      createJob(array('position' => 'FOO2'))->
      click('Delete', array(), array('method' => 'delete', '_with_csrf' => true))->

<propel>
      with('propel')->begin()->
</propel>
<doctrine>
      with('doctrine')->begin()->
</doctrine>
        check('JobeetJob', array(
          'position' => 'FOO2',
        ), false)->
      end()
    ;

Tests as a SafeGuard
--------------------

When a job is published, you cannot edit it anymore. Even if the "Edit" link
is not displayed anymore on the preview page, let's add some tests for this
requirement.

First, add another argument to the `createJob()` method to allow automatic
publication of the job, and create a `getJobByPosition()` method that returns
a job given its position value:

    [php]
    // lib/test/JobeetTestFunctional.class.php
    class JobeetTestFunctional extends sfTestFunctional
    {
      public function createJob($values = array(), $publish = false)
      {
        $this->
          get('/job/new')->
          click('Preview your job', array('job' => array_merge(array(
            'company'      => 'Sensio Labs',
            'url'          => 'http://www.sensio.com/',
            'position'     => 'Developer',
            'location'     => 'Atlanta, USA',
            'description'  => 'You will work with symfony to develop websites for our customers.',
            'how_to_apply' => 'Send me an email',
            'email'        => 'for.a.job@example.com',
            'is_public'    => false,
          ), $values)))->
          followRedirect()
        ;

        if ($publish)
        {
          $this->
            click('Publish', array(), array('method' => 'put', '_with_csrf' => true))->
            followRedirect()
          ;
        }

        return $this;
      }

<propel>
      public function getJobByPosition($position)
      {
        $criteria = new Criteria();
        $criteria->add(JobeetJobPeer::POSITION, $position);

        return JobeetJobPeer::doSelectOne($criteria);
      }
</propel>
<doctrine>
      public function getJobByPosition($position)
      {
        $q = Doctrine_Query::create()
          ->from('JobeetJob j')
          ->where('j.position = ?', $position);

        return $q->fetchOne();
      }
</doctrine>

      // ...
    }

If a job is published, the edit page must return a ~404|404 Error~ status code:

    [php]
    $browser->info('  3.5 - When a job is published, it cannot be edited anymore')->
      createJob(array('position' => 'FOO3'), true)->
      get(sprintf('/job/%s/edit', $browser->getJobByPosition('FOO3')->getToken()))->

      with('response')->begin()->
        isStatusCode(404)->
      end()
    ;

But if you run the tests, you won't have the expected result as we forgot to
implement this ~security|Security~ measure yesterday. Writing tests is also a
great way to discover bugs, as you need to think about all ~edge cases|Edge
Cases~.

Fixing the bug is quite simple as we just need to forward to a 404 page if the
job is activated:

    [php]
    // apps/frontend/modules/job/actions/actions.class.php
    public function executeEdit(sfWebRequest $request)
    {
      $job = $this->getRoute()->getObject();
      $this->forward404If($job->getIsActivated());

      $this->form = new JobeetJobForm($job);
    }

The fix is trivial, but are you sure that everything else still works as
expected? You can open your browser and start testing all possible
combinations to access the edit page. But there is a simpler way: run your
test suite; if you have introduced a ~regression|Regression~, symfony will
tell you right away.

Back to the Future in a Test
----------------------------

When a job is expiring in less than five days, or if it is already expired,
the user can extend the job validation for another 30 days from the current
date.

Testing this requirement in a browser is not easy as the expiration date is
automatically set when the job is created to 30 days in the future. So, when
getting the job page, the link to extend the job is not present. Sure, you can
hack the expiration date in the database, or tweak the template to always
display the link, but that's tedious and error prone. As you have already
guessed, writing some tests will help us one more time.

As always, we need to add a new route for the `extend` method first:

    [yml]
    # apps/frontend/config/routing.yml
    job:
      class:   sfPropelRouteCollection
      options:
        model:          JobeetJob
        column:         token
        object_actions: { publish: PUT, extend: PUT }
      requirements:
        token: \w+

Then, update the "Extend" link code in the `_admin` partial:

    [php]
    <!-- apps/frontend/modules/job/templates/_admin.php -->
    <?php if ($job->expiresSoon()): ?>
     - <?php echo link_to('Extend', 'job_extend', $job, array('method' => 'put')) ?> for another <?php echo sfConfig::get('app_active_days') ?> days
    <?php endif ?>

Then, create the `extend` action:

    [php]
    // apps/frontend/modules/job/actions/actions.class.php
    public function executeExtend(sfWebRequest $request)
    {
      $request->checkCSRFProtection();

      $job = $this->getRoute()->getObject();
      $this->forward404Unless($job->extend());

<propel>
      $this->getUser()->setFlash('notice', sprintf('Your job validity has been extended until %s.', $job->getExpiresAt('m/d/Y')));
</propel>
<doctrine>
      $this->getUser()->setFlash('notice', sprintf('Your job validity has been extended until %s.', $job->getDateTimeObject('expires_at')->format('m/d/Y')));
</doctrine>

      $this->redirect('job_show_user', $job);
    }

As expected by the action, the `extend()` method of `JobeetJob` returns `true`
if the job has been extended or `false` otherwise:

<propel>
    [php]
    // lib/model/JobeetJob.php
    class JobeetJob extends BaseJobeetJob
    {
      public function extend()
      {
        if (!$this->expiresSoon())
        {
          return false;
        }

        $this->setExpiresAt(time() + 86400 * sfConfig::get('app_active_days'));

        return $this->save();
      }

      // ...
    }
</propel>
<doctrine>
    [php]
    // lib/model/doctrine/JobeetJob.class.php
    class JobeetJob extends BaseJobeetJob
    {
      public function extend()
      {
        if (!$this->expiresSoon())
        {
          return false;
        }

        $this->setExpiresAt(date('Y-m-d', time() + 86400 * sfConfig::get('app_active_days')));

        $this->save();

        return true;
      }

      // ...
    }
</doctrine>

Eventually, add a test scenario:

    [php]
    $browser->info('  3.6 - A job validity cannot be extended before the job expires soon')->
      createJob(array('position' => 'FOO4'), true)->
      call(sprintf('/job/%s/extend', $browser->getJobByPosition('FOO4')->getToken()), 'put', array('_with_csrf' => true))->
      with('response')->begin()->
        isStatusCode(404)->
      end()
    ;

    $browser->info('  3.7 - A job validity can be extended when the job expires soon')->
      createJob(array('position' => 'FOO5'), true)
    ;

    $job = $browser->getJobByPosition('FOO5');
<propel>
    $job->setExpiresAt(time());
</propel>
<doctrine>
    $job->setExpiresAt(date('Y-m-d'));
</doctrine>
    $job->save();

    $browser->
      call(sprintf('/job/%s/extend', $job->getToken()), 'put', array('_with_csrf' => true))->
      with('response')->isRedirected()
    ;

<propel>
    $job->reload();
    $browser->test()->is(
      $job->getExpiresAt('y/m/d'),
      date('y/m/d', time() + 86400 * sfConfig::get('app_active_days'))
    );
</propel>
<doctrine>
    $job->refresh();
    $browser->test()->is(
      $job->getDateTimeObject('expires_at')->format('y/m/d'),
      date('y/m/d', time() + 86400 * sfConfig::get('app_active_days'))
    );
</doctrine>

This test scenario introduces a few new things:

 * The `call()` method retrieves a URL with a method different from `GET` or
   `POST`
<propel>
 * After the job has been updated by the action, we need to reload the local
   object with `$job->reload()`
</propel>
<doctrine>
 * After the job has been updated by the action, we need to reload the local
   object with `$job->refresh()`
</doctrine>
 * At the end, we use the embedded `lime` object directly to test the new
   expiration date.

Forms Security
--------------

### Form Serialization Magic!

##ORM## ~form|Forms~s are very easy to use as they automate a lot of work. For
instance, serializing a form to the database is as simple as a call to
`$form->save()`.

But how does it work? Basically, the `save()` method follows the following
steps:

 * Begin a transaction (because nested ##ORM## forms are all saved in one fell
   swoop)
 * Process the submitted values (by calling `updateCOLUMNColumn()` methods if
   they exist)
 * Call ##ORM## object `fromArray()` method to update the column values
 * Save the object to the database
 * Commit the transaction

### Built-in Security Features

The `fromArray()` method takes an array of values and updates the
corresponding column values. Does this represent a ~security|Security~ issue?
What if someone tries to submit a value for a column for which he does not
have authorization? For instance, can I force the `token` column?

Let's write a test to simulate a job submission with a `token` field:

    [php]
    // test/functional/frontend/jobActionsTest.php
    $browser->
      get('/job/new')->
      click('Preview your job', array('job' => array(
        'token' => 'fake_token',
      )))->

      with('form')->begin()->
        hasErrors(7)->
        hasGlobalError('extra_fields')->
      end()
    ;

When submitting the form, you must have an `extra_fields` global error. That's
because by default forms do not allow extra fields to be present in the
submitted values. That's also why all form fields must have an associated
validator.

>**TIP**
>You can also submit additional fields from the comfort of your browser using
>tools like the Firefox Web Developer Toolbar.

You can bypass this security measure by setting the `allow_extra_fields`
option to `true`:

    [php]
    class MyForm extends sfForm
    {
      public function configure()
      {
        // ...

        $this->validatorSchema->setOption('allow_extra_fields', true);
      }
    }

The test must now pass but the `token` value has been filtered out of the
values. So, you are still not able to bypass the security measure. But if you
really want the value, set the `filter_extra_fields` option to `false`:

    [php]
    $this->validatorSchema->setOption('filter_extra_fields', false);

>**NOTE**
>The tests written in this section are only for demonstration purpose. You
>can now remove them from the Jobeet project as tests do not need to validate
>symfony features.

### ~XSS~ and ~CSRF~ Protection

During chapter 1, you learned the `generate:app` task created a secured
application by default.

First, it enabled the protection against XSS. It means that all variables used
in templates are escaped by default. If you try to submit a job description
with some HTML tags inside, you will notice that when symfony renders the job
page, the HTML tags from the description are not interpreted, but rendered as
plain text.

Then, it enabled the CSRF protection. When a CSRF token is set, all forms
embed a `_csrf_token` hidden field.

>**TIP**
>The escaping strategy and the CSRF secret can be changed at any time by
>editing the `apps/frontend/config/settings.yml` ~configuration|onfiguration~
>file. As for the `databases.yml` file, the settings are configurable by
>environment:
>
>     [yml]
>     all:
>       .settings:
>         # Form security secret (CSRF protection)
>         csrf_secret: Unique$ecret
>
>         # Output escaping settings

Maintenance Tasks
-----------------

Even if symfony is a web framework, it comes with a ~command line|Command
Line~ tool. You have already used it to create the default directory structure
of the project and the application, but also to generate various files for the
model. Adding a new ~task|Tasks~ is quite easy as the tools used by the
symfony command line are packaged in a framework.

When a user creates a job, he must activate it to put it online. But if not,
the database will grow with stale jobs. Let's create a task that remove stale
jobs from the database. This task will have to be run regularly in a cron job.

    [php]
    // lib/task/JobeetCleanupTask.class.php
    class JobeetCleanupTask extends sfBaseTask
    {
      protected function configure()
      {
        $this->addOptions(array(
<doctrine>
          new sfCommandOption('application', null, sfCommandOption::PARAMETER_REQUIRED, 'The application', 'frontend'),
</doctrine>
          new sfCommandOption('env', null, sfCommandOption::PARAMETER_REQUIRED, 'The environement', 'prod'),
          new sfCommandOption('days', null, sfCommandOption::PARAMETER_REQUIRED, '', 90),
        ));

        $this->namespace = 'jobeet';
        $this->name = 'cleanup';
        $this->briefDescription = 'Cleanup Jobeet database';

        $this->detailedDescription = <<<EOF
    The [jobeet:cleanup|INFO] task cleans up the Jobeet database:

      [./symfony jobeet:cleanup --env=prod --days=90|INFO]
    EOF;
      }

      protected function execute($arguments = array(), $options = array())
      {
        $databaseManager = new sfDatabaseManager($this->configuration);

<propel>
        $nb = JobeetJobPeer::cleanup($options['days']);
        $this->logSection('propel', sprintf('Removed %d stale jobs', $nb));
</propel>
<doctrine>
        $nb = Doctrine::getTable('JobeetJob')->cleanup($options['days']);
        $this->logSection('doctrine', sprintf('Removed %d stale jobs', $nb));
</doctrine>
      }
    }

The task configuration is done in the `configure()` method. Each task must
have a unique name (`namespace`:`name`), and can have arguments and options.

>**TIP**
>Browse the built-in symfony tasks (`lib/task/`) for more examples of usage.

The `jobeet:cleanup` task defines two options: `--env` and `--days` with some
sensible defaults.

Running the task is similar to run any other symfony built-in task:

    $ php symfony jobeet:cleanup --days=10 --env=dev

<propel>
As always, the database cleanup code has been factored out in the
`JobeetJobPeer` class:

    [php]
    // lib/model/JobeetJobPeer.php
    static public function cleanup($days)
    {
      $criteria = new Criteria();
      $criteria->add(self::IS_ACTIVATED, false);
      $criteria->add(self::CREATED_AT, time() - 86400 * $days, Criteria::LESS_THAN);

      return self::doDelete($criteria);
    }

The `doDelete()` method removes database records matching the given `Criteria`
object. It can also takes an array of primary keys.
</propel>
<doctrine>
As always, the database cleanup code has been factored out in the
`JobeetJobTable` class:

    [php]
    // lib/model/doctrine/JobeetJobTable.class.php
    public function cleanup($days)
    {
      $q = $this->createQuery('a')
        ->delete()
        ->andWhere('a.is_activated = ?', 0)
        ->andWhere('a.created_at < ?', date('Y-m-d', time() - 86400 * $days));

      return $q->execute();
    }
</doctrine>

>**NOTE**
>The symfony tasks behave nicely with their environment as they return a
>value according to the success of the task. You can force a return value
>by returning an integer explicitly at the end of the task.

Final Thoughts
--------------

Testing is at the heart of the symfony philosophy and tools. In this chapter,
we have learned again how to leverage symfony tools to make the development process
easier, faster, and more important, safer.

The symfony form framework provides much more than just widgets and
validators: it gives you a simple way to test your forms and ensure that your
forms are secure by default.

Our tour of great symfony features do not end today. In the next chapter, we
will create the backend application for Jobeet. Creating a backend interface is
a must for most web projects, and Jobeet is no different. But how will we be
able to develop such an interface in just one hour? Simple, we will use the
symfony admin generator framework.
