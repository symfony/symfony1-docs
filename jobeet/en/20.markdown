Day 20: The Plugins
===================

Yesterday you learned how to internationalize and localize your symfony
applications. Once again, thanks to the ICU standard and a lot of helpers,
symfony makes this really easy.

Today, we will talk about ~plugins|Plugins~: what they are, what you can bundle in a
plugin, and what they can be used for.

Plugins
-------

### A symfony Plugin

A symfony plugin offers a way to package and distribute a subset of your
project files. Like a project, a plugin can contain classes, helpers,
configuration, tasks, modules, schemas, and even web assets.

### ~Private Plugins~

The first usage of plugins is to ease sharing code between your applications,
or even between different projects. Recall that symfony applications only share
the model. Plugins provide a way to share more components between applications.

If you need to ~reuse|Code reuse~ the same schema for different projects, or the same
modules, move them to a plugin. As a plugin is just a directory, you can
move it around quite easily by creating a SVN repository and using
`svn:externals`, or by just copying the files from one project to another.

We call these "private plugins" because their usage is restricted to a single
developer or a company. They are not publicly available.

>**TIP**
>You can even create a ~package|Packaging~ out of your private plugins, create your own
>symfony plugin channel, and install them via the `plugin:install` task.

### ~Public Plugins~

Public plugins are available for the ~community|Community~ to download and install. During
<propel>
this tutorial, we have used a couple of public plugins: `sfGuardPlugin` and
`sfFormExtraPlugin`.
</propel>
<doctrine>
this tutorial, we have used a couple of public plugins: `sfDoctrineGuardPlugin`
and `sfFormExtraPlugin`.
</doctrine>

They are exactly the same as private plugins. The only difference is that
anybody can install them for their projects. You will learn later on how to
publish and host a public plugin on the symfony website.

### A Different Way to ~Organize Code|Code Organization~

There is one more way to think about plugins and how to use them. Forget about
re-usability and sharing. Plugins can be used as a different way to organize
your code. Instead of organizing the files by layers: all models in the
`lib/model/` directory, templates in the `templates/` directory, ...; the
files are put together by feature: all the job files together (the model,
modules, and templates), all the CMS files together, and so on.

Plugin File Structure
---------------------

A plugin is just a directory ~structure|Structure~ with files organized in a pre-defined
structure, according to the nature of the files. Today, we will move most of
the code we have written for Jobeet in a `sfJobeetPlugin`. The basic layout we
will use is as follows:

    sfJobeetPlugin/
<propel>
      config/
        sfJobeetPluginConfiguration.class.php // Plugin initialization
        schema.yml                            // Database schema
        routing.yml                           // Routing
</propel>
<doctrine>
      config/
        sfJobeetPluginConfiguration.class.php // Plugin initialization
        routing.yml                           // Routing
        doctrine/
          schema.yml                          // Database schema
</doctrine>
      lib/
        Jobeet.class.php                      // Classes
        helper/                               // Helpers
        filter/                               // Filter classes
        form/                                 // Form classes
        model/                                // Model classes
        task/                                 // Tasks
      modules/
        job/                                  // Modules
          actions/
          config/
          templates/
      web/                                    // Assets like JS, CSS, and images

The Jobeet Plugin
-----------------

Bootstrapping a plugin is as simple as creating a new directory under
`plugins/`. For Jobeet, let's create a `sfJobeetPlugin` directory:

    $ mkdir plugins/sfJobeetPlugin

>**NOTE**
>All plugins must end with `Plugin`. It is also a good habit to ~prefix|Prefix~ them
>with `sf`, although it is not mandatory.

### The Model

<propel>
First, move the `config/schema.yml` file to `plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/config/`:
</propel>
<doctrine>
First, move the `config/doctrine/schema.yml` file to `plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/config/`:
</doctrine>

    $ mkdir plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/config/
<propel>
    $ mv config/schema.yml plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/config/schema.yml
</propel>
<doctrine>
    $ mkdir plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/config/doctrine
    $ mv config/doctrine/schema.yml plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/config/doctrine/schema.yml
</doctrine>

>**NOTE**
>All commands are for Unix like environments. If you use Windows, you can drag
>and drop files in the Explorer. And if you use ~Subversion~, or any other tool
>to manage your code, use the built-in tools they provide (like `svn mv` to
>move files).

Move model, form, and filter files to `plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/lib/`:

    $ mkdir plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/lib/
    $ mv lib/model/ plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/lib/
    $ mv lib/form/ plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/lib/
    $ mv lib/filter/ plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/lib/

<doctrine>
After you move the models, forms and filters the classes must be renamed, made
abstract and prefixed with the word `Plugin`.

>**TIP**
>Only ~prefix|Prefix~ the auto-generated classes with `Plugin` and not all classes. 
>For example do not prefix any classes you wrote by hand. Only the auto-generated 
>ones require the prefix.

Here is an example where we move the `JobeetAffiliate` and 
`JobeetAffiliateTable` classes.

    $ mv plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/lib/model/doctrine/JobeetAffiliate.class.php plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/lib/model/doctrine/PluginJobeetAffiliate.class.php

And the code should be updated:

    [php]
    abstract class PluginJobeetAffiliate extends BaseJobeetAffiliate
    {
      public function preValidate($event)
      {
        $object = $event->getInvoker();

        if (!$object->getToken())
        {
          $object->setToken(sha1($object->getEmail().rand(11111, 99999)));
        }
      }

      // ...
    }

Now lets move the `JobeetAffiliateTable` class:

    $ mv plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/lib/model/doctrine/JobeetAffiliateTable.class.php plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/lib/model/doctrine/PluginJobeetAffiliateTable.class.php

The class definition should now look like the following:

    [php]
    abstract class PluginJobeetAffiliateTable extends Doctrine_Table
    {
      // ...
    }

Now do the same thing for the forms and filter classes. Rename them to include
a prefix with the word `Plugin`.

Make sure to remove the `base` directory in
`plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/lib/*/doctrine/` for `form`, `filter`, and `model`
directories:

    $ rm -rf plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/lib/form/doctrine/base
    $ rm -rf plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/lib/filter/doctrine/base
    $ rm -rf plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/lib/model/doctrine/base

Once you have moved, renamed and removed some forms, filters and model classes
run the tasks to build the re-build all the classes:

    $ php symfony doctrine:build --all-classes

Now you will notice some new directories created to hold the models created
from the schema included with the `sfJobeetPlugin` at
`lib/model/doctrine/sfJobeetPlugin/`.

This directory contains the top level models and the base classes generated
from the schema. For example the model `JobeetJob` now has this class
structure:

  * `JobeetJob` (extends `PluginJobeetJob`) in
    `lib/model/doctrine/sfJobeetPlugin/JobeetJob.class.php`:
    Top level class where all project model functionality can be placed. This
    is where you can add and override functionality that comes with the plugin
    models.

  * `PluginJobeetJob` (extends `BaseJobeetJob`) in
    `plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/lib/model/doctrine/PluginJobeetJob.class.php`:
    This class contains all the plugin specific functionality. You can
    override functionality in this class and the base by modifying the
    `JobeetJob` class.

  * `BaseJobeetJob` (extends `sfDoctrineRecord`) in
    `lib/model/doctrine/sfJobeetPlugin/base/BaseJobeetJob.class.php`:
    Base class that is generated from the yaml schema file each time you run
    `doctrine:build --model`.

  * `JobeetJobTable` (extends `PluginJobeetJobTable`) in
    `lib/model/doctrine/sfJobeetPlugin/JobeetJobTable.class.php`:
    Same as the `JobeetJob` class except this is the instance of
    `Doctrine_Table` that will be returned when you call
    `Doctrine::getTable('JobeetJob')`.

  * `PluginJobeetJobTable` (extends `Doctrine_Table`) in
    `lib/model/doctrine/sfJobeetPlugin/JobeetJobTable.class.php`:
    This class contains all the plugin specific functionality for the instance
    of `Doctrine_Table` that will be returned when you call
    `Doctrine::getTable('JobeetJob')`.

With this generated structure you have the ability to customize the models of a
plugin by editing the top level `JobeetJob` class. You can customize the schema
and add columns, add relationships by overriding the `setTableDefinition()` and
`setUp()` methods.

>**NOTE**
>When you move the form classes, be sure to change the `configure()` method to 
>a `setup()` method and call `parent::setup()`. Below is an example.
>
>     [php]
>     abstract class PluginJobeetAffiliateForm extends BaseJobeetAffiliateForm
>     {
>       public function setup()
>       {
>         parent::setup();
>       }
>       
>       // ...
>     }
</doctrine>

<propel>
If you were to run the `propel:build-model` task now, symfony would still
generate the files under `lib/model/`, which is not what we want. The Propel
output directory can be configured by adding a `package` option. Open the
`schema.yml` and add the following configuration:

    [yml]
    # plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/config/schema.yml
    propel:
      _attributes:      { package: plugins.sfJobeetPlugin.lib.model }

Now symfony will generate its files under the
`plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/lib/model/` directory. The form and filter builders
also take this configuration into account when they generate files.

The `propel:build-sql` task generates a SQL file to create tables. As the
file is named after the package, remove the current one:

    $ rm data/sql/lib.model.schema.sql

Now, if you run `propel:build-all-load`, symfony will generate files under the
plugin `lib/model/` directory as expected:

    $ php symfony propel:build-all-load --no-confirmation

After running the task, check that no `lib/model/` directory has been created.
The task has created `lib/form/` and `lib/filter/` directories, however. They
both include base classes for all Propel forms in your project.

As these files are global for a project, remove them from the plugin:

    $ rm plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/lib/form/BaseFormPropel.class.php
    $ rm plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/lib/filter/BaseFormFilterPropel.class.php
</propel>
<doctrine>
We need to make sure our plugin doesn't have the base classes for all Doctrine
forms. These files are global for a project and will be re-generated with the 
`doctrine:build --forms` and `doctrine:build --filters`.

Remove the files from the plugin:

    $ rm plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/lib/form/doctrine/BaseFormDoctrine.class.php
    $ rm plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/lib/filter/doctrine/BaseFormFilterDoctrine.class.php
</doctrine>

You can also move the `Jobeet.class.php` file to the plugin:

    $ mv lib/Jobeet.class.php plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/lib/

As we have moved files around, clear the cache:

    $ php symfony cc

>**TIP**
>If you use a PHP accelerator like APC and things get weird at this point,
>restart Apache.

Now that all the model files have been moved to the plugin, run the tests to
check that everything still works fine:

    $ php symfony test:all

### The Controllers and the Views

The next logical step is to move the modules to the plugin. To avoid module
name collisions, it is always a good habit to ~prefix|Prefix~ plugin module names 
with the plugin name:

    $ mkdir plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/modules/
    $ mv apps/frontend/modules/affiliate plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/modules/sfJobeetAffiliate
    $ mv apps/frontend/modules/api plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/modules/sfJobeetApi
    $ mv apps/frontend/modules/category plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/modules/sfJobeetCategory
    $ mv apps/frontend/modules/job plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/modules/sfJobeetJob
    $ mv apps/frontend/modules/language plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/modules/sfJobeetLanguage

For each module, you also need to change the class name in all
`actions.class.php` and `components.class.php` files (for instance, the
`affiliateActions` class needs to be renamed to `sfJobeetAffiliateActions`).

The `include_partial()` and `include_component()` calls must also be changed
in the following templates:

  * `sfJobeetAffiliate/templates/_form.php` (change `affiliate` to `sfJobeetAffiliate`)
  * `sfJobeetCategory/templates/showSuccess.atom.php`
  * `sfJobeetCategory/templates/showSuccess.php`
  * `sfJobeetJob/templates/indexSuccess.atom.php`
  * `sfJobeetJob/templates/indexSuccess.php`
  * `sfJobeetJob/templates/searchSuccess.php`
  * `sfJobeetJob/templates/showSuccess.php`
  * `apps/frontend/templates/layout.php`

Update the `search` and `delete` actions:

    [php]
    // plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/modules/sfJobeetJob/actions/actions.class.php
    class sfJobeetJobActions extends sfActions
    {
      public function executeSearch(sfWebRequest $request)
      {
        if (!$query = $request->getParameter('query'))
        {
          return $this->forward('sfJobeetJob', 'index');
        }

<propel>
        $this->jobs = JobeetJobPeer::getForLuceneQuery($query);
</propel>
<doctrine>
        $this->jobs = Doctrine::getTable('JobeetJob')
          ➥ ->getForLuceneQuery($query);
</doctrine>

        if ($request->isXmlHttpRequest())
        {
          if ('*' == $query || !$this->jobs)
          {
            return $this->renderText('No results.');
          }
          else
          {
            return $this->renderPartial('sfJobeetJob/list',
             ➥ array('jobs' => $this->jobs));
          }
        }
      }

      public function executeDelete(sfWebRequest $request)
      {
        $request->checkCSRFProtection();

        $jobeet_job = $this->getRoute()->getObject();
        $jobeet_job->delete();

        $this->redirect('sfJobeetJob/index');
      }

      // ...
    }

Now, modify the `routing.yml` file to take these changes into account:

    [yml]
    # apps/frontend/config/routing.yml
    affiliate:
      class:   sfPropelRouteCollection
      options:
        model:          JobeetAffiliate
        actions:        [new, create]
        object_actions: { wait: GET }
        prefix_path:    /:sf_culture/affiliate
        module:         sfJobeetAffiliate
      requirements:
        sf_culture: (?:fr|en)

    api_jobs:
      url:     /api/:token/jobs.:sf_format
      class:   sfPropelRoute
      param:   { module: sfJobeetApi, action: list }
      options: { model: JobeetJob, type: list, method: getForToken }
      requirements:
        sf_format: (?:xml|json|yaml)

    category:
      url:     /:sf_culture/category/:slug.:sf_format
      class:   sfPropelRoute
      param:   { module: sfJobeetCategory, action: show, sf_format: html }
      options: { model: JobeetCategory, type: object, method: doSelectForSlug }
      requirements:
        sf_format: (?:html|atom)
        sf_culture: (?:fr|en)

    job_search:
      url:   /:sf_culture/search
      param: { module: sfJobeetJob, action: search }
      requirements:
        sf_culture: (?:fr|en)

    job:
      class:   sfPropelRouteCollection
      options:
        model:          JobeetJob
        column:         token
        object_actions: { publish: PUT, extend: PUT }
        prefix_path:    /:sf_culture/job
        module:         sfJobeetJob
      requirements:
        token: \w+
        sf_culture: (?:fr|en)

    job_show_user:
      url:     /:sf_culture/job/:company_slug/:location_slug/:id/:position_slug
      class:   sfPropelRoute
<propel>
      options:
        model: JobeetJob
        type: object
        method_for_criteria: doSelectActive
</propel>
<doctrine>
      options:
        model: JobeetJob
        type: object
        method_for_query: retrieveActiveJob
</doctrine>
      param:   { module: sfJobeetJob, action: show }
      requirements:
        id:        \d+
        sf_method: GET
        sf_culture: (?:fr|en)

    change_language:
      url:   /change_language
      param: { module: sfJobeetLanguage, action: changeLanguage }

    localized_homepage:
      url:   /:sf_culture/
      param: { module: sfJobeetJob, action: index }
      requirements:
        sf_culture: (?:fr|en)

    homepage:
      url:   /
      param: { module: sfJobeetJob, action: index }

Eventually, enable the plugin by hand in `ProjectConfiguration.class.php` as
it was not installed via the `plugin:install` task:

    [php]
    // config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php
    class ProjectConfiguration extends sfProjectConfiguration
    {
      public function setup()
      {
<propel>
        $this->enablePlugins('sfPropelPlugin', 'sfGuardPlugin', 'sfFormExtraPlugin', 'sfJobeetPlugin');
</propel>
<doctrine>
        $this->enablePlugins('sfDoctrinePlugin', 'sfDoctrineGuardPlugin', 'sfFormExtraPlugin', 'sfJobeetPlugin');
</doctrine>
      }
    }

If you try to browse the Jobeet website now, you will have exceptions
telling you that the modules are not enabled. As plugins are shared amongst
all applications in a project, you need to specifically enable the module you
need for a given application in its `settings.yml` configuration file:

    [yml]
    # apps/frontend/config/settings.yml
    all:
      .settings:
        enabled_modules:
          - default
          - sfJobeetAffiliate
          - sfJobeetApi
          - sfJobeetCategory
          - sfJobeetJob
          - sfJobeetLanguage

The last step of the migration is to fix the functional tests where we test
for the module name.

### The Tasks

Tasks can be moved to the plugin quite easily:

    $ mv lib/task plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/lib/

### The i18n Files

A plugin can also contain XLIFF files:

    $ mv apps/frontend/i18n plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/

### The Routing

A plugin can also contain routing rules:

    $ mv apps/frontend/config/routing.yml plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/config/

### The Assets

Even if it is a bit counter-intuitive, a plugin can also contain web assets
like images, stylesheets, and JavaScripts. As we don't want to distribute the
Jobeet plugin, it does not really make sense, but it is possible by creating a
`plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/web/` directory.

A plugin's assets must be accessible in the project's `web/` directory to be
viewable from a browser. The `plugin:publish-assets` addresses this by
creating symlinks under Unix system and by copying the files on the Windows
platform:

    $ php symfony plugin:publish-assets

### The User

Moving the `myUser` class methods that deal with job history is a bit more
involved. We could create a `JobeetUser` class and make `myUser` inherit from
it. But there is a better way, especially if several plugins want to add new
methods to the class.

Core symfony objects notify events during their life-cycle that you can listen
to. In our case, we need to listen to the `user.method_not_found` event, which
occurs when an undefined method is called on the `sfUser` object.

When symfony is initialized, all plugins are also initialized if they have a
plugin configuration class:

    [php]
    // plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/config/sfJobeetPluginConfiguration.class.php
    class sfJobeetPluginConfiguration extends sfPluginConfiguration
    {
      public function initialize()
      {
        $this->dispatcher->connect('user.method_not_found', array('JobeetUser', 'methodNotFound'));
      }
    }

Event notifications are managed by
[`sfEventDispatcher`](http://www.symfony-project.org/api/1_3/sfEventDispatcher),
the event dispatcher object. Registering a listener is as simple as calling
the `connect()` method. The `connect()` method connects an event name to a PHP
callable.

>**NOTE**
>A [PHP callable](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.is-callable.php) is a
>PHP variable that can be used by the `call_user_func()` function and returns
>`true` when passed to the `is_callable()` function. A string represents a
>function, and an array can represent an object method or a class method.

With the above code in place, `myUser` object will call the static
`methodNotFound()` method of the `JobeetUser` class whenever it is unable to
find a method. It is then up to the `methodNotFound()` method to process the
missing method or not.

Remove all methods from the `myUser` class and create the `JobeetUser` class:

    [php]
    // apps/frontend/lib/myUser.class.php
    class myUser extends sfBasicSecurityUser
    {
    }

    // plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/lib/JobeetUser.class.php
    class JobeetUser
    {
      static public function methodNotFound(sfEvent $event)
      {
        if (method_exists('JobeetUser', $event['method']))
        {
          $event->setReturnValue(call_user_func_array(
            array('JobeetUser', $event['method']),
            array_merge(array($event->getSubject()), $event['arguments'])
          ));

          return true;
        }
      }

      static public function isFirstRequest(sfUser $user, $boolean = null)
      {
        if (is_null($boolean))
        {
          return $user->getAttribute('first_request', true);
        }
        else
        {
          $user->setAttribute('first_request', $boolean);
        }
      }

      static public function addJobToHistory(sfUser $user, JobeetJob $job)
      {
        $ids = $user->getAttribute('job_history', array());

        if (!in_array($job->getId(), $ids))
        {
          array_unshift($ids, $job->getId());
          $user->setAttribute('job_history', array_slice($ids, 0, 3));
        }
      }

      static public function getJobHistory(sfUser $user)
      {
<propel>
        return JobeetJobPeer::retrieveByPks($user->getAttribute('job_history', array()));
</propel>
<doctrine>
        $ids = $user->getAttribute('job_history', array());

        if (!empty($ids))
        {
          return Doctrine::getTable('JobeetJob')
            ->createQuery('a')
            ->whereIn('a.id', $ids)
            ->execute();
        } else {
          return array();
        }
</doctrine>
      }

      static public function resetJobHistory(sfUser $user)
      {
        $user->getAttributeHolder()->remove('job_history');
      }
    }

When the dispatcher calls the `methodNotFound()` method, it passes a
[`sfEvent`](http://www.symfony-project.org/api/1_3/sfEvent) object.

If the method exists in the `JobeetUser` class, it is called and its returned
value is subsequently returned to the notifier. If not, symfony will try the
next registered listener or throw an Exception.

The `getSubject()` method returns the notifier of the event, which in this
case is the current `myUser` object.

### The Default Structure vs. the Plugin Architecture

Using the plugin architecture allows you to organize your code in a different
way:

![Plugin Architecture](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_3/20/plugin_architecture.png)

Using Plugins
-------------

When you start implementing a new feature, or if you try to solve a classic
web problem, odds are that someone has already solved the same problem and
perhaps packaged the solution as a symfony plugin. To you look for a public
symfony plugin, go to the
[plugin section](http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/) of the symfony
website.

As a plugin is self-contained in a directory, there are several way to install
it:

  * Using the `plugin:install` task (it only works if the plugin developer has
    created a plugin package and uploaded it on the symfony website)
  * Downloading the package and manually un-archive it under the `plugins/`
    directory (it also need that the developer has uploaded a package)
  * Creating a `svn:externals` in `plugins/` for the plugin (it only works if
    the plugin developer host its plugin on Subversion)

The last two ways are easy but lack some flexibility. The first way allows you
to install the latest version according to the project symfony version, easily
upgrade to the latest stable release, and to easily manage dependencies
between plugins.

Contributing a Plugin
---------------------

### Packaging a Plugin

To create a plugin package, you need to add some mandatory files to the plugin
directory structure. First, create a `README` file at the root of the plugin
directory and explain how to install the plugin, what it provides, and what not.
The `README` file must be formatted with the
[Markdown format](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). This
file will be used on the symfony website as the main piece of documentation.
You can test the conversion of your README file to HTML by using the
[symfony plugin dingus](http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/markdown_dingus).

>**SIDEBAR**
>Plugin Development Tasks
>
>If you find yourself frequently creating private and/or public plugins,
>consider taking advantage of some of the tasks in the
>[sfTaskExtraPlugin](http://www.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfTaskExtraPlugin).
>This plugin, maintained by the core team, includes a number of tasks that
>help you streamline the plugin lifecycle:
>
> * `generate:plugin`
> * `plugin:package`

You also need to create a `LICENSE` file. Choosing a license is not an easy
task, but the symfony plugin section only lists plugins that are released
under a license similar to the symfony one (MIT, BSD, LGPL, and PHP). The
content of the `LICENSE` file will be displayed under the license tab of your
plugin's public page.

The last step is to create a `package.xml` file at the root of the plugin
directory. This `package.xml` file follows the
[PEAR package syntax](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/guide-developers.php).

>**NOTE**
>The best way to learn the `package.xml` syntax is certainly to copy the one
>used by an
>[existing plugin](http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfGuardPlugin/branches/1.2/package.xml).

The `package.xml` file is composed of several parts as you can see in this
template example:

    [xml]
    <!-- plugins/sfJobeetPlugin/package.xml -->
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <package packagerversion="1.4.1" version="2.0"
       xmlns="http://pear.php.net/dtd/package-2.0"
       xmlns:tasks="http://pear.php.net/dtd/tasks-1.0"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://pear.php.net/dtd/tasks-1.0
       http://pear.php.net/dtd/tasks-1.0.xsd http://pear.php.net/dtd/package-2.0
       http://pear.php.net/dtd/package-2.0.xsd"

        <!-- CONTENT -->

      <phprelease>
    </phprelease>

    <changelog>
      <!-- CHANGELOG -->
    </changelog>
    </package>

The `<contents>` tag contains the files that need to be put into the package:

    [xml]
    <contents>
      <dir name="/">
        <file role="data" name="README" />
        <file role="data" name="LICENSE" />

        <dir name="config">
          <file role="data" name="config.php" />
          <file role="data" name="schema.yml" />
        </dir>

        <!-- ... -->
      </dir>
    </contents>

The `<dependencies>` tag references all dependencies the plugin might have:
PHP, symfony, and also other plugins. This information is used by the
`plugin:install` task to install the best plugin version for the project
environment and to also install required plugin dependencies if any.

    [xml]
    <dependencies>
      <required>
        <php>
          <min>5.0.0</min>
        </php>
        <pearinstaller>
          <min>1.4.1</min>
        </pearinstaller>
        <package>
          <name>symfony</name>
          <channel>pear.symfony-project.com</channel>
          <min>1.2.0</min>
          <max>1.3.0</max>
          <exclude>1.3.0</exclude>
        </package>
      </required>
    </dependencies>

You should always declare a dependency on symfony, as we have done here.
Declaring a minimum and a maximum version allows the `plugin:install` to know
what symfony version is mandatory as symfony versions can have slightly
different APIs.

Declaring a dependency with another plugin is also possible:

    [xml]
    <package>
      <name>sfFooPlugin</name>
      <channel>plugins.symfony-project.org</channel>
      <min>1.0.0</min>
      <max>1.2.0</max>
      <exclude>1.2.0</exclude>
    </package>

The `<changelog>` tag is optional but gives useful information about what
changed between releases. This information is available under the "Changelog"
tab and also in the
[plugin feed](http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/recently.rss).

    [xml]
    <changelog>
      <release>
        <version>
          <release>1.0.0</release>
          <api>1.0.0</api>
        </version>
        <stability>

### Hosting a Plugin on the symfony Website

If you develop a useful plugin and you want to share it with the symfony
community, [create a symfony account](http://www.symfony-project.org/user/new)
if you don't have one already and then, create a
[new plugin](http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/new).

You will automatically become the administrator for the plugin and you will
see an "admin" tab in the interface. In this tab, you will find everything you
need to manage your plugin and upload your packages.

>**NOTE**
>The [plugin FAQ](http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/FAQ) contains a lot
>of useful information for plugin developers.

See you Tomorrow
----------------

Creating plugins, and sharing them with the community is one of the best ways
to contribute back to the symfony project. It is so easy, that the symfony
plugin repository is full of useful, fun, but also ridiculous plugins.
