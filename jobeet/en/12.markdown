Day 12: The Admin Generator
===========================

With the addition we made yesterday on Jobeet, the frontend application is now
fully useable by job seekers and job posters. It's time to talk a bit about
the backend application.

Today, thanks to the ~admin generator|Admin Generator~ functionality of
symfony, we will develop a complete backend interface for Jobeet in just one
hour.

Backend Creation
----------------

The very first step is to create the ~backend|Backend~ application. If your
memory serves you well, you should remember how to do it with the
`generate:app` task:

    $ php symfony generate:app backend

The backend application is now available at
`http://jobeet.localhost/backend.php/` for the `prod` environment, and at
`http://jobeet.localhost/backend_dev.php/` for the `dev` environment.

>**NOTE**
>When you created the frontend application, the production front controller was
>named `index.php`. As you can only have one `index.php` file per directory,
>symfony creates an `index.php` file for the very first production front
>controller and names the others after the application name.

If you try to reload the data fixtures with the `propel:data-load` task, it
won't work anymore. That's because the `JobeetJob::save()` method needs access
to the ~`app.yml`~ configuration file from the `frontend` application. As we
have now two applications, symfony uses the first it finds, which is now the
`backend` one.

But as seen during day 8, the settings can be configured at different levels.
By moving the content of the `apps/frontend/config/app.yml` file to
`config/app.yml`, the settings will be shared among all applications and the
problem will be fixed. Do the change now as we will use the model classes
quite extensively in the admin generator, and so we will need the variables
defined in `app.yml` in the backend application.

>**TIP**
>The `propel:data-load` task also takes a `--application` option. So, if you
>need some specific settings from one ~application|Application~ or another, 
>this is the way to go:
>
>     $ php symfony propel:data-load --application=frontend

Backend Modules
---------------

For the frontend application, the `propel:generate-module` task has been used
to bootstrap a basic ~CRUD~ module based on a model class. For the backend,
the `propel:generate-admin` task will be used as it generates a full working
backend interface for a model class:

    $ php symfony propel:generate-admin backend JobeetJob --module=job
    $ php symfony propel:generate-admin backend JobeetCategory
       ➥ --module=category

These two commands create a `job` and a `category` ~module|Module~ for the
`JobeetJob` and the `JobeetCategory` model classes respectively.

The optional `--module` option overrides the `module` name generated by
default by the task (which would have been otherwise `jobeet_job` for the
`JobeetJob` class).

Behind the scenes, the task has also created a custom route for each module:

    [yml]
    # apps/backend/config/routing.yml
    jobeet_job:
      class: sfPropelRouteCollection
      options:
        model:                JobeetJob
        module:               job
        prefix_path:          job
        column:               id
        with_wildcard_routes: true

It should come as no surprise that the route class used by the ~admin
generator|Admin Generator~ is `sfPropelRouteCollection`, as the main goal of
an admin interface is the management of the life-cycle of model objects.

The route definition also defines some options we have not seen before:

  * `prefix_path`: Defines the prefix path for the generated route (for
                   instance, the edit page will be something like
                   `/job/1/edit`).
  * `column`: Defines the table column to use in the URL for links that
              references an object.
  * `with_wildcard_routes`: As the admin interface will have more than the
                            classic CRUD operations, this option allows to
                            define more object and collection actions without
                            editing the route.

>**TIP**
>As always, it is a good idea to read the help before using a new task.
>
>     $ php symfony help propel:generate-admin
>
>It will give you all the task arguments and options as well as some classic
>usage examples.

Backend Look and Feel
---------------------

Right off the bat, you can use the generated modules:

    http://jobeet.localhost/backend_dev.php/job
    http://jobeet.localhost/backend_dev.php/category

The admin modules have many more features than the simple modules we have
generated in previous days. Without writing a single line of PHP, each module
provides these great features:

  * The list of objects is **paginated**
  * The list is **sortable**
  * The list can be **filtered**
  * Objects can be **created**, **edited**, and **deleted**
  * Selected objects can be deleted in a **batch**
  * The form **validation** is enabled
  * **Flash messages** give immediate feedback to the user
  * ... and much much more

The admin generator provides all the features you need to create a backend
interface in a simple to configure package.

To make the user experience a bit better, we need to customize the default
backend. We will also add a simple menu to make it easy to navigate between
the different modules.

Replace the default `~layout|Layout~.php` file content with the code below:

    [php]
    // apps/backend/templates/layout.php
    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
      "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

                <img src="/images/logo.jpg" alt="Jobeet Job Board" />
              </a>
            </h1>
          </div>

          <div id="menu">
            <ul>

              </li>
              <li>
<propel>
                <?php echo link_to('Categories', '@jobeet_category') ?>
</propel>
<doctrine>
                <?php echo link_to('Categories', '@jobeet_category_category') ?>
</doctrine>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div id="content">

          </div>

          <div id="footer">

          </div>
        </div>
      </body>
    </html>

This layout uses an `admin.css` stylesheet. This file must already be present
in `web/css/` as it was installed with the other stylesheets during day 4.

![The admin generator look and feel](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_3/12/look_and_feel.png)

Eventually, change the default symfony ~homepage|Homepage~ in `routing.yml`:

    [yml]
    # apps/backend/config/routing.yml
    homepage:
      url:   /
      param: { module: job, action: index }

The symfony Cache
-----------------

If you are curious enough, you have probably already opened the files
generated by the task under the `apps/backend/modules/` directory. If not,
please open them now. Surprise! The `templates` directories are empty, and the
`actions.class.php` files are quite empty as well:

    [php]
    // apps/backend/modules/job/actions/actions.class.php
    require_once dirname(__FILE__).'/../lib/jobGeneratorConfiguration.class.php';
    require_once dirname(__FILE__).'/../lib/jobGeneratorHelper.class.php';

    class jobActions extends autoJobActions
    {
    }

How can it possibly work? If you have a closer look, you will notice that the
`jobActions` class extends `autoJobActions`. The `autoJobActions` class is
automatically generated by symfony if it does not exist. It is to be found in
the `cache/backend/dev/modules/autoJob/` directory, which contains the "real"
module:

    [php]
    // cache/backend/dev/modules/autoJob/actions/actions.class.php
    class autoJobActions extends sfActions
    {
      public function preExecute()
      {
        $this->configuration = new jobGeneratorConfiguration();

        if (!$this->getUser()->hasCredential(
          $this->configuration->getCredentials($this->getActionName())
        ))
        {

    // ...

The way the admin generator works should remind you of some known behavior. In
fact, it is quite similar to what we have already learned about the model and
form classes. Based on the model schema definition, symfony generates the
model and form classes. For the admin generator, the generated module can be
configured by editing the `config/generator.yml` file found in the module:

    [yml]
    # apps/backend/modules/job/config/generator.yml
    generator:
      class: sfPropelGenerator
      param:
        model_class:           JobeetJob
        theme:                 admin
        non_verbose_templates: true
        with_show:             false
        singular:              ~
        plural:                ~
        route_prefix:          jobeet_job
<propel>
        with_propel_route:     1
</propel>
<doctrine>
        with_doctrine_route:   1
</doctrine>

        config:
          actions: ~
          fields:  ~
          list:    ~
          filter:  ~
          form:    ~
          edit:    ~
          new:     ~

Each time you update the `generator.yml` file, symfony regenerates the cache.
As we will see today, customizing the admin generated modules is easy, fast,
and fun.

>**NOTE**
>The automatic re-generation of ~cache|Cache~ files only occurs in the development
>environment. In the production one, you will need to clear the cache manually
>with the `cache:clear` task.

Backend Configuration
---------------------

An admin module can be customized by editing the `config` key of the
`generator.yml` file. The configuration is organized in seven sections:

  * `actions`: Default configuration for the actions found on the list and on
               the forms
  * `fields`:  Default configuration for the fields
  * `list`:    Configuration for the list
  * `filter`:  Configuration for the filters
  * `form`:    Configuration for the new/edit form
  * `edit`:    Specific configuration for the edit page
  * `new`:     Specific configuration for the new page

Let's start the customization.

Title Configuration
-------------------

The `list`, `edit`, and `new` section titles of `category` module can be
customized by defining a `title` option:

    [yml]
    # apps/backend/modules/category/config/generator.yml
    config:
      actions: ~
      fields:  ~
      list:
        title: Category Management
      filter:  ~
      form:    ~
      edit:
        title: Editing Category "%%name%%"
      new:
        title: New Category

The `title` for the `edit` section contains dynamic values: all strings
enclosed between `%%` are replaced by their corresponding object column
values.

![Titles](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_3/12/title.png)

The configuration for the `job` module is quite similar:

    [yml]
    # apps/backend/modules/job/config/generator.yml
    config:
      actions: ~
      fields:  ~
      list:
        title: Job Management
      filter:  ~
      form:    ~
      edit:
        title: Editing Job "%%company%% is looking for a %%position%%"
      new:
        title: Job Creation

Fields Configuration
--------------------

The different views (`list`, `new`, and `edit`) are composed of
~fields|Fields~. A field can be a column of the model class, or a virtual
column as we will see later on.

The default fields configuration can be customized with the `fields` section:

    [yml]
    # apps/backend/modules/job/config/generator.yml
    config:
      fields:
        is_activated: { label: Activated?, help: Whether the user has activated the job, or not }
        is_public:    { label: Public?, help: Whether the job can also be published on affiliate websites, or not }

![Fields Configuration](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_3/12/fields.png)

The `fields` section overrides the fields configuration for all views, which
means that the `label` for the `is_activated` field will be changed for the
`list`, `edit`, and `new` views.

The admin generator configuration is based on a configuration cascade
principle. For instance, if you want to change a ~label|Forms Labels~ for the
`list` view only, define a `fields` option under the `list` section:

    [yml]
    # apps/backend/modules/job/config/generator.yml
    config:
      list:
        fields:
          is_public:    { label: "Public? (label for the list)" }

Any configuration that is set under the main `fields` section can be
overridden by view-specific configuration. The overriding rules are the
following:

 * `new` and `edit` inherit from `form` which inherits from `fields`
 * `list` inherits from `fields`
 * `filter` inherits from `fields`

>**NOTE**
>For form sections (`form`, `edit`, and `new`), the `label` and `help` options
>override the ones defined in the form classes.

List View Configuration
-----------------------

### `display`

By default, the columns of the list view are all the columns of the model, in
the order of the schema file. The `display` option overrides the default by
defining the ordered columns to be displayed:

    [yml]
    # apps/backend/modules/category/config/generator.yml
    config:
      list:
        title:   Category Management
        display: [=name, slug]

The `=` sign before the `name` column is a convention to convert the string to
a ~link|Links~.

![Table list](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_3/12/list_columns.png)

Let's do the same for the `job` module to make it more readable:

    [yml]
    # apps/backend/modules/job/config/generator.yml
    config:
      list:
        title:   Job Management
        display: [company, position, location, url, is_activated, email]

### `layout`

The list can be displayed with different ~layout|Layout~s. By default, the
layout is `~tabular|Tabular Layout~`, which means that each column value is in
its own table column. But for the `job` module, it would be better to use the
`~stacked|Stacked Layout~` layout, which is the other built-in layout:

    [yml]
    # apps/backend/modules/job/config/generator.yml
    config:
      list:
        title:   Job Management
        layout:  stacked
        display: [company, position, location, url, is_activated, email]
        params:  |
          %%is_activated%% <small>%%category_id%%</small> - %%company%%
           (<em>%%email%%</em>) is looking for a %%=position%% (%%location%%)

In a `stacked` layout, each object is represented by a single string, which
is defined by the `params` option.

>**NOTE**
>The `display` option is still needed as it defines the columns that will be
>sortable by the user.

### "Virtual" columns

With this configuration, the `%%category_id%%` segment will be replaced by the
category primary key. But it would be more meaningful to display the name of
the category.

Whenever you use the `%%` notation, the variable does not need to correspond
to an actual column in the database schema. The admin generator only need to
find a related getter in the model class.

To display the category name, we can define a `getCategoryName()` method in
the `JobeetJob` model class and replace `%%category_id%%` by
`%%category_name%%`.

But the `JobeetJob` class already has a `getJobeetCategory()` method that
returns the related category object. And if you use `%%jobeet_category%%`, it
works as the `JobeetCategory` class has a magic `__toString()` method that
converts the object to a string.

    [yml]
    # apps/backend/modules/job/config/generator.yml
    %%is_activated%% <small>%%jobeet_category%%</small> - %%company%%
     (<em>%%email%%</em>) is looking for a %%=position%% (%%location%%)

![Stacked layout](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_3/12/stacked_layout.png)

### `sort`

As an administrator, you will be probably more interested in seeing the latest
posted jobs. You can configure the default sort column by adding a `sort`
option:

    [yml]
    # apps/backend/modules/job/config/generator.yml
    config:
      list:
        sort: [expires_at, desc]

### `max_per_page`

By default, the list is ~paginated|Pagination~ and each page contains 20
items. This can be changed with the `~max_per_page~` option:

    [yml]
    # apps/backend/modules/job/config/generator.yml
    config:
      list:
        max_per_page: 10

![Max per page](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_3/12/max_per_page.png)

### `batch_actions`

On a list, an action can be run on several objects. These batch actions are
not needed for the `category` module, so, let's remove them:

    [yml]
    # apps/backend/modules/category/config/generator.yml
    config:
      list:
        batch_actions: {}

![Remove the batch actions](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_3/12/no_batch_actions.png)

The `batch_actions` option defines the list of batch actions. The empty array
allows the removal of the feature.

By default, each module has a `delete` batch action defined by the framework,
but for the `job` module, let's pretend we need a way to extend the validity
of some selected jobs for another 30 days:

    [yml]
    # apps/backend/modules/job/config/generator.yml
    config:
      list:
        batch_actions:
          _delete:    ~
          extend:     ~

All actions beginning with a `_` are built-in actions provided by the
framework. If you refresh your browser and select the extend batch actions,
symfony will throw an exception telling you to create a `executeBatchExtend()`
method:

    [php]
    // apps/backend/modules/job/actions/actions.class.php
    class jobActions extends autoJobActions
    {
      public function executeBatchExtend(sfWebRequest $request)
      {
        $ids = $request->getParameter('ids');

<propel>
        $jobs = JobeetJobPeer::retrieveByPks($ids);

        foreach ($jobs as $job)
</propel>
<doctrine>
        $q = Doctrine_Query::create()
          ->from('JobeetJob j')
          ->whereIn('j.id', $ids);

        foreach ($q->execute() as $job)
</doctrine>
        {
          $job->extend(true);
        }

        $this->getUser()->setFlash('notice', 'The selected jobs have been extended successfully.');

<propel>
        $this->redirect('@jobeet_job');
</propel>
<doctrine>
        $this->redirect('@jobeet_job_job');
</doctrine>
      }
    }

The selected ~primary keys|Primary Key~ are stored in the `ids` request
parameter. For each selected job, the `JobeetJob::extend()` method is called
with an extra argument to bypass the expiration check.

Update the `extend()` method to take this new argument into account:

    [php]
<propel>
    // lib/model/JobeetJob.php
</propel>
<doctrine>
    // lib/model/doctrine/JobeetJob.class.php
</doctrine>
    class JobeetJob extends BaseJobeetJob
    {
      public function extend($force = false)
      {
        if (!$force && !$this->expiresSoon())
        {
          return false;
        }

<propel>
        $this->setExpiresAt(time() + 86400 * sfConfig::get('app_active_days'));
</propel>
<doctrine>
        $this->setExpiresAt(date('Y-m-d', time() + 86400 * sfConfig::get('app_active_days')));
</doctrine>
        $this->save();

        return true;
      }

      // ...
    }

After all jobs have been extended, the user is redirected to the `job` module
homepage.

![Custom batch actions](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_3/12/custom_batch_actions.png)

### `object_actions`

In the list, there is an additional column for actions you can run on a single
object. For the `category` module, let's remove them as we have a link on the
category name to edit it, and we don't really need to be able to delete one
directly from the list:

    [yml]
    # apps/backend/modules/category/config/generator.yml
    config:
      list:
        object_actions: {}

For the `job` module, let's keep the existing actions and add a new `extend`
action similar to the one we have added as a batch action:

    [yml]
    # apps/backend/modules/job/config/generator.yml
    config:
      list:
        object_actions:
          extend:     ~
          _edit:      ~
          _delete:    ~

As for batch actions, the `_delete` and `_edit` actions are the ones defined
by the framework. We need to define the `listExtend()` action to make the
`extend` link work:

    [php]
    // apps/backend/modules/job/actions/actions.class.php
    class jobActions extends autoJobActions
    {
      public function executeListExtend(sfWebRequest $request)
      {
        $job = $this->getRoute()->getObject();
        $job->extend(true);

        $this->getUser()->setFlash('notice', 'The selected jobs have been extended successfully.');

<propel>
        $this->redirect('@jobeet_job');
</propel>
<doctrine>
        $this->redirect('@jobeet_job_job');
</doctrine>
      }

      // ...
    }

![Custom object action](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_3/12/custom_object_actions.png)

### `actions`

We have already seen how to link an action to a list of objects or a single
object. The `actions` option defines actions that take no object at all, like
the creation of a new object. Let's remove the default `new` action and add a
new action that deletes all jobs that have not been activated by the poster
for more than 60 days:

    [yml]
    # apps/backend/modules/job/config/generator.yml
    config:
      list:
        actions:
          deleteNeverActivated: { label: Delete never activated jobs }

Until now, all actions we have defined had `~`, which means that symfony
configures the action automatically. Each action can be customized by defining
an array of parameters. The `label` option overrides the default
~label|Labels~ generated by symfony.

By default, the action executed when you click on the link is the name of the
action prefixed with `list`.

Create the `listDeleteNeverActivated` action in the `job` module:

    [php]
    // apps/backend/modules/job/actions/actions.class.php
    class jobActions extends autoJobActions
    {
      public function executeListDeleteNeverActivated(sfWebRequest $request)
      {
<propel>
        $nb = JobeetJobPeer::cleanup(60);
</propel>
<doctrine>
        $nb = Doctrine::getTable('JobeetJob')->cleanup(60);
</doctrine>

        if ($nb)
        {
          $this->getUser()->setFlash('notice', sprintf('%d never activated jobs have been deleted successfully.', $nb));
        }
        else
        {
          $this->getUser()->setFlash('notice', 'No job to delete.');
        }

<propel>
        $this->redirect('@jobeet_job');
</propel>
<doctrine>
        $this->redirect('@jobeet_job_job');
</doctrine>
      }

      // ...
    }

<propel>
We have reused the `JobeetJobPeer::cleanup()` method defined yesterday. That's
another great example of the reusability provided by the MVC pattern.
</propel>
<doctrine>
We have reused the `JobeetJobTable::cleanup()` method defined yesterday. That's
another great example of the reusability provided by the MVC pattern.
</doctrine>

>**NOTE**
>You can also change the action to execute by passing an `action` parameter:
>
>     [yml]
>     deleteNeverActivated: { label: Delete never activated jobs, action: foo }

![Actions](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_3/12/actions.png)

<propel>
### `peer_method`
</propel>
<doctrine>
### `table_method`
</doctrine>

The number of database requests needed to display the job list page is 14, as
shown by the ~web debug toolbar|Web Debug Toolbar~.

If you click on that number, you will see that most requests are to retrieve
the category name for each job:

![Number of requests before](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_3/12/web_debug_before.png)

To reduce the number of requests, we can change the default method used to get
<propel>
the jobs by using the `peer_method` option:
</propel>
<doctrine>
the jobs by using the `table_method` option:
</doctrine>

    [yml]
    # apps/backend/modules/job/config/generator.yml
    config:
      list:
<propel>
        peer_method: doSelectJoinJobeetCategory

The `doSelectJoinJobeetCategory()` method adds a join between the `job` and
the `category` tables and automatically creates the category object related to
each job.
</propel>
<doctrine>
        table_method: retrieveBackendJobList

Now you must create the `retrieveBackendJobList` method in `JobeetJobTable`
located in `lib/model/doctrine/JobeetJobTable.class.php`.

    [php]
    // lib/model/doctrine/JobeetJobTable.class.php
    class JobeetJobTable extends Doctrine_Table
    {
      public function retrieveBackendJobList(Doctrine_Query $q)
      {
        $rootAlias = $q->getRootAlias();
        $q->leftJoin($rootAlias . '.JobeetCategory c');
        return $q;
      }

      // ...

The `retrieveBackendJobList()` method adds a ~join~ between the `job` and
the `category` tables and automatically creates the category object related to
each job.
</doctrine>

The number of requests is now down to four:

![Number of requests after](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_3/12/web_debug_after.png)

Form Views Configuration
------------------------

The form views configuration is done in three sections: `form`, `edit`, and
`new`. They all have the same configuration capabilities and the `form`
section only exists as a fallback for the `edit` and `new` sections.

### `display`

As for the list, you can change the order of the displayed fields with the
`display` option. But as the displayed form is defined by a class, don't try
to remove a field as it could lead to unexpected validation errors.

The `display` option for form views can also be used to arrange fields into
groups:

    [yml]
    # apps/backend/modules/job/config/generator.yml
    config:
      form:
        display:
          Content: [category_id, type, company, logo, url, position,
            ➥ location, description, how_to_apply, is_public, email]
          Admin:   [_generated_token, is_activated, expires_at]

The above configuration defines two groups (`Content` and `Admin`), each
containing a subset of the form fields.

![Fields grouping](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_3/12/fields_grouping.png)

>**NOTE**
>The columns in the `Admin` group do not show up in the browser yet because
>they have been unset in the job form definition. They will appear in a few
>sections when we define a custom job form class for the admin application.

The admin generator has built-in support for many to many relationship. On the
category form, you have an input for the name, one for the slug, and a
drop-down box for the related affiliates. As it does not make sense to edit
this relation on this page, let's remove it:

    [php]
<propel>
    // lib/form/JobeetCategoryForm.class.php
</propel>
<doctrine>
    // lib/form/doctrine/JobeetCategoryForm.class.php
</doctrine>
    class JobeetCategoryForm extends BaseJobeetCategoryForm
    {
      public function configure()
      {
<propel>
        unset($this['jobeet_category_affiliate_list']);
</propel>
<doctrine>
        unset($this['created_at'], $this['updated_at'], $this['jobeet_affiliates_list']);
</doctrine>
      }
    }

### "Virtual" columns

In the `display` options for the job form, the `_generated_token` field starts
with an underscore (`_`). This means that the rendering for this field will be
handled by a custom ~partial|Partial Templates~ named `_generated_token.php`

Create this partial with the following content:

    [php]
    // apps/backend/modules/job/templates/_generated_token.php
    <div class="sf_admin_form_row">
      <label>Token</label>
      <?php echo $form->getObject()->getToken() ?>
    </div>

In the partial, you have access to the current form (`$form`) and the related
object is accessible via the `getObject()` method.

>**NOTE**
>You can also delegate the rendering to a component by prefixing the field
>name by a tilde (`~`).

### `class`

As the form will be used by administrators, we have displayed more information
than for the user job form. But for now, some of them do not appear on the
form as they have been removed in the `JobeetJobForm` class.

To have different forms for the frontend and the backend, we need to create
two form classes. Let's create a `BackendJobeetJobForm` class that extends the
`JobeetJobForm` class. As we won't have the same hidden fields, we also need
to refactor the `JobeetJobForm` class a bit to move the `unset()` statement in
a method that will be overridden in `BackendJobeetJobForm`:

    [php]
<propel>
    // lib/form/JobeetJobForm.class.php
</propel>
<doctrine>
    // lib/form/doctrine/JobeetJobForm.class.php
</doctrine>
    class JobeetJobForm extends BaseJobeetJobForm
    {
      public function configure()
      {
        $this->removeFields();

        $this->validatorSchema['email'] = new sfValidatorAnd(array(
          $this->validatorSchema['email'],
          new sfValidatorEmail(),
        ));

        // ...
      }

      protected function removeFields()
      {
        unset(
          $this['created_at'], $this['updated_at'],
          $this['expires_at'], $this['is_activated'],
          $this['token']
        );
      }
    }

<propel>
    // lib/form/BackendJobeetJobForm.class.php
</propel>
<doctrine>
    // lib/form/doctrine/BackendJobeetJobForm.class.php
</doctrine>
    class BackendJobeetJobForm extends JobeetJobForm
    {
      public function configure()
      {
        parent::configure();
      }

      protected function removeFields()
      {
        unset(
          $this['created_at'], $this['updated_at'],
          $this['token']
        );
      }
    }

The default ~form class|Forms (Classes)~ used by the admin generator can be
overridden by setting the `class` option:

    [yml]
    # apps/backend/modules/job/config/generator.yml
    config:
      form:
        class: BackendJobeetJobForm

>**NOTE**
>As we have added a new class, don't forget to clear the cache.

The `edit` form still has a small annoyance. The current ~uploaded|File
Upload~ logo does not show up anywhere and you cannot remove the current one.
The `sfWidgetFormInputFileEditable` widget adds editing capabilities to a
simple input file widget:

    [php]
<propel>
    // lib/form/BackendJobeetJobForm.class.php
</propel>
<doctrine>
    // lib/form/doctrine/BackendJobeetJobForm.class.php
</doctrine>
    class BackendJobeetJobForm extends JobeetJobForm
    {
      public function configure()
      {
        parent::configure();

        $this->widgetSchema['logo'] = new sfWidgetFormInputFileEditable(array(
          'label'     => 'Company logo',
          'file_src'  => '/uploads/jobs/'.$this->getObject()->getLogo(),
          'is_image'  => true,
          'edit_mode' => !$this->isNew(),
          'template'  => '<div>%file%<br />%input%<br />%delete% %delete_label%</div>',
        ));

        $this->validatorSchema['logo_delete'] = new sfValidatorPass();
      }

      // ...
    }

The `sfWidgetFormInputFileEditable` widget takes several options to tweak
its features and rendering:

  * `file_src`:    The web path to the current uploaded file
  * `is_image`:    If `true`, the file will be rendered as an image
  * `edit_mode`:   Whether the form is in edit mode or not
  * `with_delete`: Whether to display the delete checkbox
  * `template`:    The template to use to render the widget

![File upload](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_3/12/file_upload.png)

>**TIP**
>The look of the admin generator can be tweaked very easily as the generated
>templates define a lot of `class` and `id` attributes. For instance, the logo field can
>be customized by using the `sf_admin_form_field_logo` class. Each field also
>has a class depending on the field type like `sf_admin_text` or
>`sf_admin_boolean`.

<propel>
The `edit_mode` option uses the `sfPropel::isNew()` method.
</propel>
<doctrine>
The `edit_mode` option uses the `sfDoctrineRecord::isNew()` method.
</doctrine>

It returns `true` if the model object of the form is new, and `false`
otherwise. This is of great help when you need to have different widgets or
validators depending on the status of the embedded object.

Filters Configuration
---------------------

Configuring filters is quite the same as configuring the form views. As a
matter of fact, filters are just forms. And as for the forms, the classes have
been generated by the `propel:build-all` task. You can also re-generate them
with the `propel:build-filters` task.

The ~form filter|Forms (Filter Classes)~ classes are located under the
`lib/filter/` directory and each model class has an associated filter form
class (`JobeetJobFormFilter` for `JobeetJobForm`).

Let's remove them completely for the `category` module:

    [yml]
    # apps/backend/modules/category/config/generator.yml
    config:
      filter:
        class: false

For the `job` module, let's remove some of them:

    [yml]
    # apps/backend/modules/job/config/generator.yml
    filter:
      display: [category_id, company, position, description, is_activated,
       ➥ is_public, email, expires_at]

As filters are always optional, there is no need to override the filter form
class to configure the fields to be displayed.

![Filters](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_3/12/filters.png)

Actions Customization
---------------------

When configuration is not sufficient, you can add new methods to the action
class as we have seen with the extend feature, but you can also override the
generated action methods:

 | Method                 | Description
 | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------
 | `executeIndex()`       | `list` view action
 | `executeFilter()`      | Updates the filters
 | `executeNew()`         | `new` view action
 | `executeCreate()`      | Creates a new Job
 | `executeEdit()`        | `edit` view action
 | `executeUpdate()`      | Updates a Job
 | `executeDelete()`      | Deletes a Job
 | `executeBatch()`       | Executes a batch action
 | `executeBatchDelete()` | Executes the `_delete` batch action
 | `processForm()`        | Processes the Job form
 | `getFilters()`         | Returns the current filters
 | `setFilters()`         | Sets the filters
 | `getPager()`           | Returns the list pager
 | `getPage()`            | Gets the pager page
 | `setPage()`            | Sets the pager page
 | `buildCriteria()`      | Builds the `Criteria` for the list
 | `addSortCriteria()`    | Adds the sort `Criteria` for the list
 | `getSort()`            | Returns the current sort column
 | `setSort()`            | Sets the current sort column

As each generated method does only one thing, it is easy to change a behavior
without having to copy and paste too much code.

Templates Customization
-----------------------

We have seen how to customize the generated ~templates|Templates~ thanks to
the `class` and `id` attributes added by the admin generator in the HTML code.

As for the classes, you can also override the original templates. As templates
are plain PHP files and not PHP classes, a template can be overridden by
creating a template of the same name in the module (for instance in the
`apps/backend/modules/job/templates/` directory for the `job` admin module):

 | Template                     | Description
 | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------
 | `_assets.php`                | Renders the CSS and JS to use for templates
 | `_filters.php`               | Renders the filters box
 | `_filters_field.php`         | Renders a single filter field
 | `_flashes.php`               | Renders the flash messages
 | `_form.php`                  | Displays the form
 | `_form_actions.php`          | Displays the form actions
 | `_form_field.php`            | Displays a singe form field
 | `_form_fieldset.php`         | Displays a form fieldset
 | `_form_footer.php`           | Displays the form footer
 | `_form_header.php`           | Displays the form header
 | `_list.php`                  | Displays the list
 | `_list_actions.php`          | Displays the list actions
 | `_list_batch_actions.php`    | Displays the list batch actions
 | `_list_field_boolean.php`    | Displays a single boolean field in the list
 | `_list_footer.php`           | Displays the list footer
 | `_list_header.php`           | Displays the list header
 | `_list_td_actions.php`       | Displays the object actions for a row
 | `_list_td_batch_actions.php` | Displays the checkbox for a row
 | `_list_td_stacked.php`       | Displays the stacked layout for a row
 | `_list_td_tabular.php`       | Displays a single field for the list
 | `_list_th_stacked.php`       | Displays a single column name for the header
 | `_list_th_tabular.php`       | Displays a single column name for the header
 | `_pagination.php`            | Displays the list pagination
 | `editSuccess.php`            | Displays the `edit` view
 | `indexSuccess.php`           | Displays the `list` view
 | `newSuccess.php`             | Displays the `new` view

Final Configuration
-------------------

The final configuration for the Jobeet admin is as follows:

    [yml]
    # apps/backend/modules/job/config/generator.yml
    generator:
      class: sfPropelGenerator
      param:
        model_class:           JobeetJob

          edit:
            title: Editing Category "%%name%%"
          new:
            title: New Category

With just these two configuration files, we have developed a great backend
interface for Jobeet in a matter of minutes.

>**TIP**
>You already know that when something is configurable in a YAML file, there is
>also the possibility to use plain PHP code. For the admin generator, you can

See you Tomorrow
----------------

In just one hour, we have built a fully featured backend interface for the
Jobeet project. And all in all, we have written less than 50 lines of PHP
code. Not too bad for so many features!

Tomorrow, we will see how to secure the backend application with a username
and a password. This will also be the occasion to talk about the symfony user
class.
