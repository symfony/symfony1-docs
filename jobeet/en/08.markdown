Day 8: The Unit Tests
=====================

During the last two days, we reviewed all the features learned during the
first five days of the advent calendar to customize Jobeet features and add
new ones. In the process, we have also touched on other more advanced symfony
features.

Today, we will start talking about something completely different: automated
**tests**. As the topic is quite large, it will take us two full days to cover
everything.

Tests in symfony
----------------

There are two different kinds of automated ~test|Testing~s in symfony: **~unit tests|Unit Testing~**
and **~functional tests|Functional Testing~**.

Unit tests verify that each method and function is working properly. Each test
must be as independent as possible from the others.

On the other hand, functional tests verify that the resulting application
behaves correctly as a whole.

All tests in symfony are located under the `test/` directory of the project.
It contains two sub-directories, one for unit tests (`test/unit/`) and one for
functional tests (`test/functional/`).

Unit tests will be covered in today's tutorial, whereas tomorrow's will be
dedicated to functional tests.

Unit Tests
----------

Writing unit tests is perhaps one of the hardest web development best
practices to put into action. As web developers are not really used to test
their work, a lot of questions arise: Do I have to write tests before
implementing a feature? What do I need to test? Do my tests need to cover
every single ~edge case|Edge Cases~? How can I be sure that everything is well
tested? But usually, the first question is much more basic: Where to start?

Even if we strongly advocate testing, the symfony approach is pragmatic: it's
always better to have some tests than no test at all. Do you already have a
lot of code without any test? No problem. You don't need to have a full test
suite to benefit from the advantages of having tests. Start by adding tests
whenever you find a bug in your code. Over time, your code will become better,
the ~code coverage|Code Coverage~ will rise, and you will become more
confident about it. By starting with a pragmatic approach, you will feel more
comfortable with tests over time. The next step is to write tests for new
features. In no time, you will become test addict.

The problem with most testing libraries is their steep learning curve. That's
why symfony provides a very simple testing library, **lime**, to make writing
test insanely easy.

>**NOTE**
>Even if this tutorial describes the lime built-in library extensively, you
>can use any testing library, like the excellent
>[PHPUnit](http://www.phpunit.de/) library.

The `~lime|Lime Testing Framework~` Testing Framework
-----------------------------------------------------

All unit tests written with the lime framework start with the same code:

    [php]
    require_once dirname(__FILE__).'/../bootstrap/unit.php';

    $t = new lime_test(1);

First, the `unit.php` bootstrap file is included to initialize a few things.
Then, a new `lime_test` object is created and the number of tests planned to
be launched is passed as an argument.

>**NOTE**
>The plan allows lime to output an error message in case too few tests are run
>(for instance when a test generates a PHP fatal error).

Testing works by calling a method or a function with a set of predefined
inputs and then comparing the results with the expected output. This
comparison determines whether a test passes or fails.

To ease the comparison, the `lime_test` object provides several methods:

 Method                        | Description
 ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------
 `ok($test)`                   | Tests a condition and passes if it is true
 `is($value1, $value2)`        | Compares two values and passes if they are
                               | equal (`==`)
 `isnt($value1, $value2)`      | Compares two values and passes if they are
                               | not equal
 `like($string, $regexp)`      | Tests a string against a regular expression
 `unlike($string, $regexp)`    | Checks that a string doesn't match a regular
                               | expression
 `is_deeply($array1, $array2)` | Checks that two arrays have the same values

>**TIP**
>You may wonder why lime defines so many test methods, as all tests can be
>written just by using the `ok()` method. The benefit of alternative methods
>lies in much more explicit error messages in case of a failed test and in 
>improved readability of the tests.

The `lime_test` object also provides other convenient test methods:

 Method                  | Description
 ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------
 `fail()`                | Always fails--useful for testing exceptions
 `pass()`                | Always passes--useful for testing exceptions
 `skip($msg, $nb_tests)` | Counts as `$nb_tests` tests--useful for conditional
                         | tests
 `todo()`                | Counts as a test--useful for tests yet to be
                         | written

Finally, the `comment($msg)` method outputs a comment but runs no test.

Running Unit Tests
------------------

All unit tests are stored under the `test/unit/` directory. By convention,
tests are named after the class they test and suffixed by `Test`. Although you
can organize the files under the `test/unit/` directory anyway you like, we
recommend you replicate the directory structure of the `lib/` directory.

To illustrate unit testing, we will test the `Jobeet` class.

Create a `test/unit/JobeetTest.php` file and copy the following code inside:

    [php]
    // test/unit/JobeetTest.php
    require_once dirname(__FILE__).'/../bootstrap/unit.php';

    $t = new lime_test(1);
    $t->pass('This test always passes.');

To launch the tests, you can execute the file directly:

    $ php test/unit/JobeetTest.php

Or use the `test:unit` task:

    $ php symfony test:unit Jobeet

![Tests on the command line](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_4/08/cli_tests.png)

>**Note**
>~Windows~ command line unfortunately cannot highlight test results in
>red or green color. But if you use Cygwin, you can force symfony to use
>colors by passing the `--color` option to the task.

Testing `slugify`
-----------------

Let's start our trip to the wonderful world of unit testing by writing tests
for the `Jobeet::slugify()` method.

We created the `~slug|Slug~ify()` method during day 5 to clean up a string so
that it can be safely included in a URL. The conversion consists in some basic
transformations like converting all non-ASCII characters to a dash (`-`) or
converting the string to lowercase:

 | Input         | Output       |
 | ------------- | ------------ |
 | Sensio Labs   | sensio-labs  |
 | Paris, France | paris-france |

Replace the content of the test file with the following code:

    [php]
    // test/unit/JobeetTest.php
    require_once dirname(__FILE__).'/../bootstrap/unit.php';

    $t = new lime_test(6);

    $t->is(Jobeet::slugify('Sensio'), 'sensio');
    $t->is(Jobeet::slugify('sensio labs'), 'sensio-labs');
    $t->is(Jobeet::slugify('sensio   labs'), 'sensio-labs');
    $t->is(Jobeet::slugify('paris,france'), 'paris-france');
    $t->is(Jobeet::slugify('  sensio'), 'sensio');
    $t->is(Jobeet::slugify('sensio  '), 'sensio');

If you take a closer look at the tests we have written, you will notice that
each line only tests one thing. That's something you need to keep in mind when
writing unit tests. Test one thing at a time.

You can now execute the test file. If all tests pass, as we expect them to,
you will enjoy the "*green bar*". If not, the infamous "*red bar*" will alert
you that some tests do not pass and that you need to fix them.

![slugify() tests](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_4/08/slugify.png)

If a test fails, the output will give you some information about why it
failed; but if you have hundreds of tests in a file, it can be difficult to
quickly identify the behavior that fails.

All lime test methods take a string as their last argument that serves as the
description for the test. It's very convenient as it forces you to describe
what your are really testing. It can also serve as a form of
~documentation|Documentation~ for a method's expected behavior. Let's add some
messages to the `slugify` test file:

    [php]
    require_once dirname(__FILE__).'/../bootstrap/unit.php';

    $t = new lime_test(6);

    $t->comment('::slugify()');
    $t->is(Jobeet::slugify('Sensio'), 'sensio',
     ➥ '::slugify() converts all characters to lower case');
    $t->is(Jobeet::slugify('sensio labs'), 'sensio-labs',
     ➥ '::slugify() replaces a white space by a -');
    $t->is(Jobeet::slugify('sensio   labs'), 'sensio-labs',
     ➥ '::slugify() replaces several white spaces by a single -');
    $t->is(Jobeet::slugify('  sensio'), 'sensio',
     ➥ '::slugify() removes - at the beginning of a string');
    $t->is(Jobeet::slugify('sensio  '), 'sensio',
     ➥ '::slugify() removes - at the end of a string');
    $t->is(Jobeet::slugify('paris,france'), 'paris-france',
     ➥ '::slugify() replaces non-ASCII characters by a -');

![slugify() tests with messages](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_4/08/slugify_doc.png)

The test description string is also an valuable tool when trying to figure out
what to test. You can see a pattern in the test strings: they are sentences
describing how the method must behave and they always start with the method
name to test.

>**SIDEBAR**
>~Code Coverage~
>
>When you write tests, it is easy to forget a portion of the code.
>
>To help you check that all your code is well tested, symfony provides the
>`test:coverage` task. Pass this task a test file or directory and a lib file or
>directory as arguments and it will tell you the code coverage of your code:
>
>     $ php symfony test:coverage test/unit/JobeetTest.php lib/Jobeet.class.php
>
>If you want to know which lines are not covered by your tests, pass the
`--detailed` option:
>
>     $ php symfony test:coverage --detailed test/unit/JobeetTest.php lib/Jobeet.class.php
>
>Keep in mind that when the task indicates that your code is fully unit
>tested, it just means that each line has been executed, not that all the
>~edge cases|Edge Cases~ have been tested.
>
>As the `test:coverage` relies on `~XDebug~` to collect its information, you
>need to install it and enable it first.

Adding Tests for new Features
-----------------------------

The slug for an empty string is an empty string. You can test it, it will
work. But an empty string in a URL is not that a great idea. Let's change the
`slugify()` method so that it returns the "n-a" string in case of an empty
string.

You can write the test first, then update the method, or the other way around.
It is really a matter of taste but writing the test first gives you the
confidence that your code actually implements what you planned:

    [php]
    $t->is(Jobeet::slugify(''), 'n-a',
     ➥ '::slugify() converts the empty string to n-a');

This development methodology, where you first write tests then implement
features, is known as
[Test Driven Development (~TDD|Test Driven Development~)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Driven_Development).

If you launch the tests now, you must have a red bar. If not, it means that
the feature is already implemented or that your test does not test what it is
supposed to test.

Now, edit the `Jobeet` class and add the following condition at the beginning:

    [php]
    // lib/Jobeet.class.php
    static public function slugify($text)
    {
      if (empty($text))
      {
        return 'n-a';
      }

      // ...
    }

The test must now pass as expected, and you can enjoy the green bar, but only
if you have remembered to update the test plan. If not, you will have a
message that says you planned six tests and ran one extra. Having the planned
test count up to date is important, as it you will keep you informed if the
test script dies early on.

Adding Tests because of a Bug
-----------------------------

Let's say that time has passed and one of your users reports a weird
~bug|Debug~: some job links point to a 404 error page. After some
investigation, you find that for some reason, these jobs have an empty
company, position, or location slug.

How is it possible?

You look through the records in the database and the columns are definitely
not empty. You think about it for a while, and bingo, you find the cause. When
a string only contains non-ASCII characters, the `slugify()` method converts
it to an empty string. So happy to have found the cause, you open the `Jobeet`
class and fix the problem right away. That's a bad idea. First, let's add a
test:

    [php]
    $t->is(Jobeet::slugify(' - '), 'n-a',
     ➥ '::slugify() converts a string that only contains non-ASCII characters to n-a');

![slugify() bug](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_4/08/slugify_bug.png)

After checking that the test does not pass, edit the `Jobeet` class and move
the empty string check to the end of the method:

    [php]
    static public function slugify($text)
    {
      // ...

      if (empty($text))
      {
        return 'n-a';
      }

      return $text;
    }

The new test now passes, as do all the other ones. The `slugify()` had a
bug despite our 100% coverage.

You cannot think about all ~edge cases|Edge Cases~ when writing tests, and
that's fine. But when you discover one, you need to write a test for it before
fixing your code. It also means that your code will get better over time,
which is always a good thing.

##ORM## Unit Tests
-----------------

### Database Configuration

Unit testing a ##ORM## model class is a bit more complex as it requires a
database connection. You already have the one you use for your development,
but it is a good habit to create a dedicated database for tests.

During day 1, we introduced the ~environment|Environments~s as a way to vary
an application's settings. By default, all symfony tests are run in the `test`
environment, so let's configure a different database for the `test`
environment:

<propel>
    $ php symfony configure:database --env=test
     ➥ "mysql:host=localhost;dbname=jobeet_test" root mYsEcret
</propel>
<doctrine>
    $ php symfony configure:database --name=doctrine
     ➥ --class=sfDoctrineDatabase --env=test
     ➥ "mysql:host=localhost;dbname=jobeet_test" root mYsEcret
</doctrine>

The `env` option tells the task that the database configuration is only for
the `test` environment. When we used this task during day 3, we did not pass
any `env` option, so the configuration was applied to all environments.

>**NOTE**
>If you are curious, open the `config/databases.yml` configuration file to see
>how symfony makes it easy to change the configuration depending on the
>environment.

Now that we have configured the database, we can bootstrap it by using the
`propel:insert-sql` task:

    $ mysqladmin -uroot -pmYsEcret create jobeet_test
    $ php symfony propel:insert-sql --env=test

>**SIDEBAR**
>Configuration Principles in symfony
>
>During day 4, we saw that settings coming from configuration files
>can be defined at different levels.
>
>These ~setting|Settings~s can also be environment dependent. This is true for
>most configuration files we have used until now: `databases.yml`, ~`app.yml`~,
>~`view.yml`~, and ~`settings.yml`~. In all those files, the main key is the
>environment, the `all` key indicating its settings are for all environments:
>
>     [yml]
>     # config/databases.yml
>     dev:
>       propel:
>         class: sfPropelDatabase
<propel>
>         param:
>           classname: DebugPDO
</propel>
>
>     test:
>       propel:
>         class: sfPropelDatabase
>         param:
<propel>
>           classname: DebugPDO
</propel>
>           dsn: 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=jobeet_test'
>
>     all:
>       propel:
>         class: sfPropelDatabase
>         param:
>           dsn: 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=jobeet'
>           username: root
>           password: null

### Test Data

Now that we have a dedicated database for our tests, we need a way to load
some test data. During day 3, you learned to use the `propel:data-load`
~task|Tasks~, but for tests, we need to reload the data each time we run them
to put the database in a known state.

<propel>
The `propel:data-load` task internally uses
the [`sfPropelData`](http://www.symfony-project.org/api/1_4/sfPropelData)
class to load the data:

    [php]
    $loader = new sfPropelData();
    $loader->loadData(sfConfig::get('sf_test_dir').'/fixtures');
</propel>
<doctrine>
The `doctrine:data-load` task internally uses
the `Doctrine::loadData()` method to load the data:

    [php]
    Doctrine::loadData(sfConfig::get('sf_test_dir').'/fixtures');
</doctrine>

>**NOTE**
>The ~`sfConfig`~ object can be used to get the full path of a project
>sub-directory. Using it allows for the default directory structure to be
>customized.

The `loadData()` method takes a directory or a file as its first argument. It
can also take an array of directories and/or files.

We have already created some initial data in the `data/fixtures/` directory.
For tests, we will put the ~fixture|Fixtures~s into the `test/fixtures/`
directory. These fixtures will be used for ##ORM## unit and functional tests.

For now, copy the files from `data/fixtures/` to the `test/fixtures/`
directory.

### Testing `JobeetJob`

Let's create some unit tests for the `JobeetJob` model class.

As all our ##ORM## unit tests will begin with the same code, create a
`##ORM##.php` file in the `bootstrap/` test directory with the following code:

    [php]
    // test/bootstrap/##ORM##.php
    include(dirname(__FILE__).'/unit.php');

    $configuration =
     ➥ ProjectConfiguration::getApplicationConfiguration(
     ➥ 'frontend', 'test', true);

    new sfDatabaseManager($configuration);

<propel>
    $loader = new sfPropelData();
    $loader->loadData(sfConfig::get('sf_test_dir').'/fixtures');
</propel>
<doctrine>
    Doctrine::loadData(sfConfig::get('sf_test_dir').'/fixtures');
</doctrine>

The script is pretty self-explanatory:

  * As for the front controllers, we initialize a configuration object for the
    `test` environment:

        [php]
        $configuration =
         ➥ ProjectConfiguration::getApplicationConfiguration(
         ➥ 'frontend', 'test', true);

  * We create a database manager. It initializes the ##ORM## connection by
    loading the `databases.yml` configuration file.

        [php]
        new sfDatabaseManager($configuration);

<propel>
  * We load our test data by using `sfPropelData`:

        [php]
        $loader = new sfPropelData();
        $loader->loadData(sfConfig::get('sf_test_dir').'/fixtures');
</propel>
<doctrine>
  * We load our test data by using `Doctrine::loadData()`:

        [php]
        Doctrine::loadData(sfConfig::get('sf_test_dir').'/fixtures');
</doctrine>

>**NOTE**
>##ORM## connects to the database only if it has some SQL statements to
>execute.

Now that everything is in place, we can start testing the `JobeetJob` class.

First, we need to create the `JobeetJobTest.php` file in `test/unit/model`:

    [php]
    // test/unit/model/JobeetJobTest.php
    include(dirname(__FILE__).'/../../bootstrap/##ORM##.php');

    $t = new lime_test(1);

Then, let's start by adding a test for the `getCompanySlug()` method:

    [php]
    $t->comment('->getCompanySlug()');
<propel>
    $job = JobeetJobPeer::doSelectOne(new Criteria());
</propel>
<doctrine>
    $job = Doctrine::getTable('JobeetJob')->createQuery()->fetchOne();
</doctrine>
    $t->is($job->getCompanySlug(), Jobeet::slugify($job->getCompany()), '->getCompanySlug() return the slug for the company');

Notice that we only test the `getCompanySlug()` method and not if the slug is
correct or not, as we are already testing this elsewhere.

Writing tests for the `save()` method is slightly more complex:

    [php]
    $t->comment('->save()');
    $job = create_job();
    $job->save();
    $expiresAt = date('Y-m-d', time() + 86400
      ➥ * sfConfig::get('app_active_days'));
<propel>
    $t->is($job->getExpiresAt('Y-m-d'), $expiresAt, '->save() updates expires_at if not set');
</propel>
<doctrine>
    $t->is($job->getDateTimeObject('expires_at')->format('Y-m-d'), $expiresAt, '->save() updates expires_at if not set');
</doctrine>

    $job = create_job(array('expires_at' => '2008-08-08'));
    $job->save();
<propel>
    $t->is($job->getExpiresAt('Y-m-d'), '2008-08-08', '->save() does not update expires_at if set');
</propel>
<doctrine>
    $t->is($job->getDateTimeObject('expires_at')->format('Y-m-d'), '2008-08-08', '->save() does not update expires_at if set');
</doctrine>

    function create_job($defaults = array())
    {
      static $category = null;

      if (is_null($category))
      {
<propel>
        $category = JobeetCategoryPeer::doSelectOne(new Criteria());
</propel>
<doctrine>
        $category = Doctrine::getTable('JobeetCategory')
          ->createQuery()
          ->limit(1)
          ->fetchOne();
</doctrine>
      }

      $job = new JobeetJob();
      $job->fromArray(array_merge(array(
        'category_id'  => $category->getId(),
        'company'      => 'Sensio Labs',
        'position'     => 'Senior Tester',
        'location'     => 'Paris, France',
        'description'  => 'Testing is fun',
        'how_to_apply' => 'Send e-Mail',
        'email'        => 'job@example.com',
        'token'        => rand(1111, 9999),
        'is_activated' => true,
<propel>
      ), $defaults), BasePeer::TYPE_FIELDNAME);
</propel>
<doctrine>
      ), $defaults));
</doctrine>

      return $job;
    }

>**NOTE**
>Each time you add tests, don't forget to update the number of expected tests
>(the plan) in the `lime_test` constructor method. For the `JobeetJobTest`
>file, you need to change it from `1` to `3`.

### Test other ##ORM## Classes

You can now add tests for all other ##ORM## classes. As you are now getting
used to the process of writing unit tests, it should be quite easy.

~Unit Tests Harness~
--------------------

The `test:unit` ~task|Tasks~ can also be used to launch all unit tests for a
project:

    $ php symfony test:unit

The task outputs whether each test file passes or fails:

>**TIP**
>If the `test:unit` task returns a "~dubious status|Dubious Status~" for a
>file, it indicates that the script died before end. Running the test file
>alone will give you the exact error message.

See you Tomorrow

Even if testing an application is quite important, I know that some of you
might have been tempted to just skip today's tutorial. I'm glad you have not.

Sure, embracing symfony is about learning all the great features the framework
provides, but it's also about its ~philosophy|Philosophy~ of development and
the ~best practices|Best Practices~ it advocates. And testing is one of them.
Sooner or later, unit tests will save the day for you. They give you a solid
confidence about your code and the freedom to refactor it without fear. Unit
tests are a safe guard that will alert you if you break something. The symfony
framework itself has more than 9000 tests.

Tomorrow we will write some functional tests for the `job` and `category`
modules. Until then, take some time to write more unit tests for the Jobeet
model classes.
