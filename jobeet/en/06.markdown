Day 6: More with the Model
==========================

Yesterday was great. You learned how to create pretty URLs and how to use the
symfony framework to automate a lot of things for you.

Today, we will enhance the Jobeet website by tweaking the code here and there.
In the process, you will learn more about all the features we have introduced
during the first five days of this tutorial.

<propel>
The Propel Criteria Object
--------------------------
</propel>
<doctrine>
The Doctrine Query Object
-------------------------
</doctrine>

From the second day's requirements:

  "When a user comes to the Jobeet website, she sees a list of active jobs."

But as of now, all jobs are displayed, whether they are active or not:

    [php]
    // apps/frontend/modules/job/actions/actions.class.php
    class jobActions extends sfActions
    {
      public function executeIndex(sfWebRequest $request)
      {
<propel>
        $this->jobeet_jobs = JobeetJobPeer::doSelect(new Criteria());
</propel>
<doctrine>
        $this->jobeet_jobs = Doctrine::getTable('JobeetJob')
          ->createQuery('a')
          ->execute();
</doctrine>
      }

      // ...
    }

<propel>
An active job is one that was posted less than 30 days ago. The `doSelect()`
method takes a `~Criteria|Propel Criteria~` object that describes the database
request to execute. In the code above, an empty `Criteria` is passed, which
means that all the records are retrieved from the database. </propel> <doctrine>
An active job is one that was posted less than 30 days ago. The
`~Doctrine_Query~::execute()` method will make a request to the database. In the
code above, we are not specifying any where condition which means that all the
records are retrieved from the database.
</doctrine>

Let's change it to only select active jobs:

    [php]
    public function executeIndex(sfWebRequest $request)
    {
<propel>
      $criteria = new Criteria();
      $criteria->add(JobeetJobPeer::CREATED_AT,
       ➥ time() - 86400 * 30, Criteria::GREATER_THAN);

      $this->jobeet_jobs = JobeetJobPeer::doSelect($criteria);
</propel>
<doctrine>
      $q = Doctrine_Query::create()
        ->from('JobeetJob j')
        ->where('j.created_at > ?',
         ➥ date('Y-m-d H:i:s', time() - 86400 * 30));

      $this->jobeet_jobs = $q->execute();
</doctrine>
    }

<propel>
The `Criteria::add()` method adds a `WHERE` clause to the generated SQL. Here,
we restrict the criteria to only select jobs that are no older than 30 days. The
`add()` method accepts a lot of different comparison operators; here are the
most common ones:

  * `Criteria::EQUAL`
  * `Criteria::NOT_EQUAL`
  * `Criteria::GREATER_THAN`, `Criteria::GREATER_EQUAL`
  * `Criteria::LESS_THAN`, `Criteria::LESS_EQUAL`
  * `Criteria::LIKE`, `Criteria::NOT_LIKE`
  * `Criteria::CUSTOM`
  * `Criteria::IN`, `Criteria::NOT_IN`
  * `Criteria::ISNULL`, `Criteria::ISNOTNULL`
  * `Criteria::CURRENT_DATE`, `Criteria::CURRENT_TIME`,
    `Criteria::CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
</propel>

Debugging ##ORM## generated SQL
-------------------------------

As you don't write the SQL statements by hand, ##ORM## will take care of the
differences between database engines and will generate SQL statements optimized
for the database engine you choose during day 3. But sometimes, it is of
great help to see the SQL generated by ##ORM##; for instance, to ~debug|Debug~ a
query that does not work as expected. In the `dev` ~environment|Environments~,
symfony logs these queries (along with much more) in the `log/` directory. There
is one log file for every combination of an application and an environment. The
file we are looking for is named `frontend_dev.log`:

    # log/frontend_dev.log
<propel>
    Dec 6 15:47:12 symfony [debug] {sfPropelLogger} exec: SET NAMES 'utf8'
    Dec 6 15:47:12 symfony [debug] {sfPropelLogger} prepare: SELECT
    ➥ jobeet_job.ID, jobeet_job.CATEGORY_ID, jobeet_job.TYPE,
    ➥ jobeet_job.COMPANY, jobeet_job.LOGO, jobeet_job.URL, jobeet_job.POSITION,
    ➥ jobeet_job.LOCATION, jobeet_job.DESCRIPTION, jobeet_job.HOW_TO_APPLY,
    ➥ jobeet_job.TOKEN, jobeet_job.IS_PUBLIC, jobeet_job.CREATED_AT,
    ➥ jobeet_job.UPDATED_AT FROM `jobeet_job` WHERE jobeet_job.CREATED_AT>:p1
    Dec 6 15:47:12 symfony [debug] {sfPropelLogger} Binding '2008-11-06 15:47:12'
    ➥ at position :p1 w/ PDO type PDO::PARAM_STR

You can see for yourself that Propel has generated a where clause for the
`created_at` column (`WHERE jobeet_job.CREATED_AT > :p1`).

>**NOTE**
>The `:p1` string in the query indicates that Propel generates ~prepared statement~s.
>The actual value of `:p1` ('`2008-11-06 15:47:12`' in the example

</propel>
<doctrine>
    Dec 04 13:58:33 symfony [info] {sfDoctrineLogger} executeQuery : SELECT 
    j.id AS j__id, j.category_id AS j__category_id, j.type AS j__type, 
    j.company AS j__company, j.logo AS j__logo, j.url AS j__url, 
    j.position AS j__position, j.location AS j__location, 
    j.description AS j__description, j.how_to_apply AS j__how_to_apply, 
    j.token AS j__token, j.is_public AS j__is_public, 
    j.is_activated AS j__is_activated, j.email AS j__email, 
    j.expires_at AS j__expires_at, j.created_at AS j__created_at, 
    j.updated_at AS j__updated_at FROM jobeet_job j 
    WHERE j.created_at > ? (2008-11-08 01:13:35)

You can see for yourself that Doctrine has a where clause for the `created_at`
column (`WHERE j.created_at > ?`).

>**NOTE**
>The `?` string in the query indicates that Doctrine generates ~prepared statement~s.
>The actual value of `?` ('2008-11-08 01:13:35' in the example

>exposure to [~SQL injection~](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sql_injection) attacks.
</doctrine>

This is good, but it's a bit annoying to have to switch between the browser, the
IDE, and the log file every time you need to test a change. Thanks to the
symfony web debug toolbar, all the information you need is also available within
the comfort of your browser:

![SQL statements in the web debug toolbar](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_4/06/web_debug_sql.png)

Object ~Serialization~
----------------------

Even if the above code works, it is far from perfect as it does not take into
account some requirements from day 2:

  "A user can come back to re-activate or extend the validity of the job ad
   for an extra 30 days..."

But as the above code only relies on the `created_at` value, and because this
column stores the creation date, we cannot satisfy the above requirement.

But if you remember the database schema we have described during day 3, we
also have defined an `expires_at` column. Currently this value is always empty
as it is not set in the fixture data. But when a job is created, it can be
automatically set to 30 days after the current date.

When you need to do something automatically before a ##ORM## object is
serialized to the database, you can override the `save()` method of the model
class:

<propel>
    [php]
    // lib/model/JobeetJob.php
    class JobeetJob extends BaseJobeetJob
    {
      public function save(PropelPDO $con = null)
      {
        if ($this->isNew() && !$this->getExpiresAt())
        {
          $now = $this->getCreatedAt() ? $this->getCreatedAt('U') : time();
          $this->setExpiresAt($now + 86400 * 30);
        }

        return parent::save($con);
      }

      // ...
    }
</propel>
<doctrine>
    [php]
    // lib/model/doctrine/JobeetJob.class.php
    class JobeetJob extends BaseJobeetJob
    {
      public function save(Doctrine_Connection $conn = null)
      {
        if ($this->isNew() && !$this->getExpiresAt())
        {
          $now = $this->getCreatedAt() ? $this->getDateTimeObject('created_at')->format('U') : time();
          $this->setExpiresAt(date('Y-m-d H:i:s', $now + 86400 * 30));
        }

        return parent::save($conn);
      }

      // ...
    }
</doctrine>

The `isNew()` method returns `true` when the object has not been serialized yet
in the database, and `false` otherwise.

Now, let's change the action to use the `expires_at` column instead of the
`created_at` one to select the active jobs:

    [php]
    public function executeIndex(sfWebRequest $request)
    {
<propel>
      $criteria = new Criteria();
      $criteria->add(JobeetJobPeer::EXPIRES_AT, time(), Criteria::GREATER_THAN);

      $this->jobeet_jobs = JobeetJobPeer::doSelect($criteria);
</propel>
<doctrine>
      $q = Doctrine_Query::create()
        ->from('JobeetJob j')
        ->where('j.expires_at > ?', date('Y-m-d H:i:s', time()));

      $this->jobeet_jobs = $q->execute();
</doctrine>
    }

We restrict the query to only select jobs with the `expires_at` date in the
future.

More with Fixtures
------------------

Refreshing the Jobeet homepage in your browser won't change anything as the jobs
in the database have been posted just a few days ago. Let's change the fixtures
to add a job that is already expired:

<propel>
    [yml]
    # data/fixtures/020_jobs.yml
    JobeetJob:
      # other jobs

      expired_job:
        category_id:  programming
        company:      Sensio Labs
        position:     Web Developer
        location:     Paris, France
        description:  |
          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur
          adipisicing elit.
        how_to_apply: Send your resume to lorem.ipsum [at] dolor.sit
        is_public:    true
        is_activated: true
        created_at:   2005-12-01
        token:        job_expired
        email:        job@example.com
</propel>
<doctrine>
    [yml]
    # data/fixtures/jobs.yml
    JobeetJob:
      # other jobs

      expired_job:
        JobeetCategory: programming
        company:        Sensio Labs
        position:       Web Developer
        location:       Paris, France
        description:    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
        how_to_apply:   Send your resume to lorem.ipsum [at] dolor.sit
        is_public:      true
        is_activated:   true
        created_at:     '2005-12-01 00:00:00'
        token:          job_expired
        email:          job@example.com
</doctrine>

>**NOTE**
>Be careful when you copy and paste code in a ~fixture|Fixtures~ file to not break the
>indentation. The `expired_job` must only have two spaces before it.

As you can see in the job we have added in the fixture file, the `created_at`
column value can be defined even if it is automatically filled by ##ORM##. The
defined value will override the default one. Reload the fixtures and refresh
your browser to ensure that the old job does not show up:

    $ php symfony propel:data-load

You can also execute the following query to make sure that the `expires_at`
column is automatically filled by the `save()` method, based on the `created_at`
value:

    SELECT `position`, `created_at`, `expires_at` FROM `jobeet_job`;

Custom Configuration
--------------------

In the `JobeetJob::save()` method, we have hardcoded the number of days for the
job to expire. It would have been better to make the 30 days configurable. The
symfony framework provides a built-in configuration file for
~application|Application~ specific ~settings|Settings~, the ~`app.yml`~ file.
This YAML file can contain any setting you want:

    [yml]
    # apps/frontend/config/app.yml
    all:
      active_days: 30

In the application, these settings are available through the global ~`sfConfig`~
class:

    [php]
    sfConfig::get('app_active_days')

The setting has been prefixed by `app_` because the `sfConfig` class also
provides access to symfony settings as we will see later on.

Let's update the code to take this new setting into account:

<propel>
    [php]
    public function save(PropelPDO $con = null)
    {
      if ($this->isNew() && !$this->getExpiresAt())
      {
        $now = $this->getCreatedAt() ? $this->getCreatedAt('U') : time();
        $this->setExpiresAt($now + 86400 *
         ➥ sfConfig::get('app_active_days'));
      }

      return parent::save($con);
    }
</propel>
<doctrine>
    [php]
    public function save(Doctrine_Connection $conn = null)
    {
      if ($this->isNew() && !$this->getExpiresAt())
      {
        $now = $this->getCreatedAt() ? $this->getDateTimeObject('created_at')->format('U') : time();
        $this->setExpiresAt(date('Y-m-d H:i:s', $now + 86400 * sfConfig::get('app_active_days')));
      }

      return parent::save($conn);
    }
</doctrine>

The ~`app.yml`~ configuration file is a great way to centralize ~global
settings|Global Settings~ for your application.

Last, if you need ~project-wide settings|Global Configuration~, just create a
new `app.yml` file in the `config` folder at the root of your symfony project.

Refactoring
-----------

Although the code we have written works fine, it's not quite right yet. Can you
spot the problem?

<propel>
The `Criteria` code does not belong to the action (the Controller layer), it
belongs to the Model layer. In the ~MVC~ model, the Model defines all the
~business logic|Business Logic~, and the Controller only calls the Model to
retrieve data from it. As the code returns a collection of jobs, let's move the
code to the `JobeetJobPeer` class and create a `getActiveJobs()` method: </propel>
<doctrine>
The `Doctrine_Query` code does not belong to the action (the Controller layer),
it belongs to the Model layer. In the ~MVC~ model, the Model defines all the
~business logic|Business Logic~, and the Controller only calls the Model to
retrieve data from it. As the code returns a collection of jobs, let's move the
code to the `JobeetJobTable` class and create a `getActiveJobs()` method:
</doctrine>

<propel>
    [php]
    // lib/model/JobeetJobPeer.php
    class JobeetJobPeer extends BaseJobeetJobPeer
    {
      static public function getActiveJobs()
      {
        $criteria = new Criteria();
        $criteria->add(self::EXPIRES_AT, time(),
          ➥ Criteria::GREATER_THAN);

        return self::doSelect($criteria);
      }
    }
</propel>
<doctrine>
    [php]
    // lib/model/doctrine/JobeetJobTable.class.php
    class JobeetJobTable extends Doctrine_Table
    {
      public function getActiveJobs()
      {
        $q = $this->createQuery('j')
          ->where('j.expires_at > ?', date('Y-m-d H:i:s', time()));

        return $q->execute();
      }
    }
</doctrine>

Now the action code can use this new method to retrieve the active jobs.

    [php]
    public function executeIndex(sfWebRequest $request)
    {
<propel>
      $this->jobeet_jobs = JobeetJobPeer::getActiveJobs();
</propel>
<doctrine>
      $this->jobeet_jobs =
        ➥ Doctrine_Core::getTable('JobeetJob')->getActiveJobs();
</doctrine>
    }

This ~refactoring|Refactoring~ has several benefits over the previous code:

 * The logic to get the active jobs is now in the Model, where it belongs
 * The code in the controller is thinner and much more readable
 * The `getActiveJobs()` method is re-usable (for instance in another action)
 * The model code is now unit testable

Let's sort the jobs by the `expires_at` column:

    [php]
<propel>
    static public function getActiveJobs()
    {
      $criteria = new Criteria();
      $criteria->add(self::EXPIRES_AT, time(), Criteria::GREATER_THAN);
      $criteria->addDescendingOrderByColumn(self::EXPIRES_AT);

      return self::doSelect($criteria);
    }
</propel>
<doctrine>
    public function getActiveJobs()
    {
      $q = $this->createQuery('j')
        ->where('j.expires_at > ?', date('Y-m-d H:i:s', time()))
        ->orderBy('j.expires_at DESC');

      return $q->execute();
    }
</doctrine>

<propel>
The `addDescendingOrderByColumn()` method adds an `ORDER BY` clause to the
generated SQL (`addAscendingOrderByColumn()` also exists).
</propel>
<doctrine>
The `orderBy` methods sets the `ORDER BY` clause to the generated SQL
(`addOrderBy()` also exists).
</doctrine>

Categories on the Homepage
--------------------------

From the second day's requirements:

  "The jobs are sorted by category and then by publication date (newer jobs
  first)."

Until now, we have not taken the job category into account. From the
requirements, the homepage must display jobs by category. First, we need to get
all categories with at least one active job.

<propel>
Open the `JobeetCategoryPeer` class and add a `getWithJobs()` method:
</propel>
<doctrine>
Open the `JobeetCategoryTable` class and add a `getWithJobs()` method:
</doctrine>

<propel>
    [php]
    // lib/model/JobeetCategoryPeer.php
    class JobeetCategoryPeer extends BaseJobeetCategoryPeer
    {
      static public function getWithJobs()
      {
        $criteria = new Criteria();
        $criteria->addJoin(self::ID, JobeetJobPeer::CATEGORY_ID);
        $criteria->add(JobeetJobPeer::EXPIRES_AT, time(), Criteria::GREATER_THAN);
        $criteria->setDistinct();

        return self::doSelect($criteria);
      }
    }

The `Criteria::addJoin()` method adds a `~JOIN~` clause to the generated SQL. By
default, the join condition is added to the `WHERE` clause. You can also change
the join operator by adding a third argument (`Criteria::LEFT_JOIN`,
`Criteria::RIGHT_JOIN`, and `Criteria::INNER_JOIN`).
</propel>
<doctrine>
    [php]
    // lib/model/doctrine/JobeetCategoryTable.class.php
    class JobeetCategoryTable extends Doctrine_Table
    {
      public function getWithJobs()
      {
        $q = $this->createQuery('c')
          ->leftJoin('c.JobeetJobs j')
          ->where('j.expires_at > ?', date('Y-m-d H:i:s', time()));

        return $q->execute();
      }
    }
</doctrine>

Change the `index` action accordingly:

    [php]
    // apps/frontend/modules/job/actions/actions.class.php
    public function executeIndex(sfWebRequest $request)
    {
<propel>
      $this->categories = JobeetCategoryPeer::getWithJobs();
</propel>
<doctrine>
      $this->categories =
       ➥ Doctrine_Core::getTable('JobeetCategory')->getWithJobs();
</doctrine>
    }

In the template, we need to iterate through all categories and display the
active jobs:

    [php]
    // apps/frontend/modules/job/templates/indexSuccess.php
    <?php use_stylesheet('jobs.css') ?>

    <div id="jobs">
      <?php foreach ($categories as $category): ?>
        <div class="category_<?php echo Jobeet::slugify($category->getName()) ?>">
          <div class="category">
            <div class="feed">
              <a href="">Feed</a>
            </div>
            <h1><?php echo $category ?></h1>
          </div>

          <table class="jobs">
            <?php foreach ($category->getActiveJobs() as $i => $job): ?>
              <tr class="<?php echo fmod($i, 2) ? 'even' : 'odd' ?>">
                <td class="location">
                  <?php echo $job->getLocation() ?>
                </td>
                <td class="position">
                  <?php echo link_to($job->getPosition(), 'job_show_user', $job) ?>
                </td>
                <td class="company">
                  <?php echo $job->getCompany() ?>
                </td>
              </tr>
            <?php endforeach; ?>
          </table>
        </div>
      <?php endforeach; ?>
    </div>

>**NOTE**
>To display the category name in the template, we have used `echo $category`.
>Does this sound weird? `$category` is an object, how can `echo` magically

<propel>
For this to work, we need to add the `getActiveJobs()` method to the
`JobeetCategory` class that returns the active jobs for the category object:

    [php]
    // lib/model/JobeetCategory.php
    public function getActiveJobs()
    {
      $criteria = new Criteria();
      $criteria->add(JobeetJobPeer::CATEGORY_ID, $this->getId());

      return JobeetJobPeer::getActiveJobs($criteria);
    }

In the `add()` call, we have omitted the third argument as `Criteria::EQUAL` is
the default value.

The `JobeetCategory::getActiveJobs()` method uses the
`JobeetJobPeer::getActiveJobs()` method to retrieve the active jobs for the
given category.

When calling the `JobeetJobPeer::getActiveJobs()`, we want to restrict the
condition even more by providing a category. Instead of passing the category
object, we have decided to pass a `Criteria` object as this is the best way to
encapsulate a generic condition.

The `getActiveJobs()` needs to merge this `Criteria` argument with its own
criteria. As the `Criteria` is an object, this is quite simple:

    [php]
    // lib/model/JobeetJobPeer.php
    static public function getActiveJobs(Criteria $criteria = null)
    {
      if (is_null($criteria))
      {
        $criteria = new Criteria();
      }

      $criteria->add(JobeetJobPeer::EXPIRES_AT, time(),
       ➥ Criteria::GREATER_THAN);
      $criteria->addDescendingOrderByColumn(self::EXPIRES_AT);

      return self::doSelect($criteria);
    }
</propel>
<doctrine>
For this to work, we need to add the `getActiveJobs()` method to the
`JobeetCategory` class:

    [php]
    // lib/model/doctrine/JobeetCategory.class.php
    public function getActiveJobs()
    {
      $q = Doctrine_Query::create()
        ->from('JobeetJob j')
        ->where('j.category_id = ?', $this->getId());

      return Doctrine_Core::getTable('JobeetJob')->getActiveJobs($q);
    }

The `JobeetCategory::getActiveJobs()` method uses the
`Doctrine_Core::getTable('JobeetJob')->getActiveJobs()` method to retrieve the
active jobs for the given category.

When calling the `Doctrine_Core::getTable('JobeetJob')->getActiveJobs()`, we
want to restrict the condition even more by providing a category. Instead of
passing the category object, we have decided to pass a `Doctrine_Query` object
as this is the best way to encapsulate a generic condition.

The `getActiveJobs()` needs to merge this `Doctrine_Query` object with its own
query. As the `Doctrine_Query` is an object, this is quite simple:

    [php]
    // lib/model/doctrine/JobeetJobTable.class.php
    public function getActiveJobs(Doctrine_Query $q = null)
    {
      if (is_null($q))
      {
        $q = Doctrine_Query::create()
          ->from('JobeetJob j');
      }

      $q->andWhere('j.expires_at > ?', date('Y-m-d H:i:s', time()))
        ->addOrderBy('j.expires_at DESC');

      return $q->execute();
    }
</doctrine>

Limit the Results
-----------------

There is still one requirement to implement for the homepage job list:

  "For each category, the list only shows the first 10 jobs and a link allows 
  to list all the jobs for a given category."

That's simple enough to add to the `getActiveJobs()` method:

<propel>
    [php]
    // lib/model/JobeetCategory.php
    public function getActiveJobs($max = 10)
    {
      $criteria = new Criteria();
      $criteria->add(JobeetJobPeer::CATEGORY_ID, $this->getId());
      $criteria->setLimit($max);

      return JobeetJobPeer::getActiveJobs($criteria);
    }
</propel>
<doctrine>
    [php]
    // lib/model/doctrine/JobeetCategory.class.php
    public function getActiveJobs($max = 10)
    {
      $q = Doctrine_Query::create()
        ->from('JobeetJob j')
        ->where('j.category_id = ?', $this->getId())
        ->limit($max);

      return Doctrine_Core::getTable('JobeetJob')->getActiveJobs($q);
    }
</doctrine>

The appropriate ~`LIMIT`~ clause is now hard-coded into the Model, but it is
better for this value to be configurable. Change the template to pass a maximum
number of jobs set in `app.yml`:

    [php]
    <!-- apps/frontend/modules/job/templates/indexSuccess.php -->
    <?php foreach ($category->getActiveJobs(sfConfig::get('app_max_jobs_on_homepage')) as $i => $job): ?>

and add a new setting in `app.yml`:

    [yml]
    all:
      active_days:          30
      max_jobs_on_homepage: 10

Dynamic Fixtures
----------------

Unless you lower the `max_jobs_on_homepage` setting to one, you won't see any
difference. We need to add a bunch of jobs to the ~fixture|Fixtures~. So, you
can copy and paste an existing job ten or twenty times by hand... but there's a
better way. Duplication is bad, even in fixture files.

symfony to the rescue! ~YAML~ files in symfony can contain PHP code that will be
evaluated just before the parsing of the file. Edit the
<propel>
`020_jobs.yml` fixtures file and add the following code at the end:
</propel>
<doctrine>
`jobs.yml` fixtures file and add the following code at the end:
</doctrine>

    [php]
    # Starts at the beginning of the line (no whitespace before)
    <?php for ($i = 100; $i <= 130; $i++): ?>
      job_<?php echo $i ?>:
<propel>
        category_id:  programming
</propel>
<doctrine>
        JobeetCategory: programming
</doctrine>
        company:      Company <?php echo $i."\n" ?>
        position:     Web Developer
        location:     Paris, France
        description:  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
        how_to_apply: |
          Send your resume to lorem.ipsum [at] company_<?php echo $i ?>.sit
        is_public:    true
        is_activated: true
        token:        job_<?php echo $i."\n" ?>
        email:        job@example.com

    <?php endfor ?>

Be careful, the YAML parser won't like you if you mess up with ~Indentation|Code
Formatting~. Keep in mind the following simple tips when adding PHP code to a
YAML file:

 * The `<?php ?>` statements must always start the line or be embedded in a
   value.

 * If a `<?php ?>` statement ends a line, you need to explicly output a new
   line ("\n").

You can now reload the fixtures with the `propel:data-load` task and see if only
`10` jobs are displayed on the homepage for the `Programming` category. In the
following screenshot, we have changed the maximum number of jobs to five to make
the image smaller:

Secure the Job Page
-------------------

When a job expires, even if you know the URL, it must not be possible to access
it anymore. Try the URL for the expired job (replace the `id` with the actual
`id` in your database - `SELECT id, token FROM jobeet_job WHERE expires_at <
NOW()`):

    /frontend_dev.php/job/sensio-labs/paris-france/ID/web-developer-expired

Instead of displaying the job, we need to forward the user to a 404 page. But
how can we do this as the job is retrieved automatically by the route?

<propel>
By default, the ~`sfPropelRoute`~ uses the standard `doSelectOne()` method to
retrieve the object, but you can change it by providing a
`~method_for_criteria~` option in the ~route|Route~ configuration:
</propel>

    [yml]
    # apps/frontend/config/routing.yml
    job_show_user:
      url:     /job/:company_slug/:location_slug/:id/:position_slug
      class:   sfPropelRoute
      options:
        model: JobeetJob
        type:  object
<propel>
        method_for_criteria: doSelectActive
</propel>
<doctrine>
        method_for_query: retrieveActiveJob
</doctrine>
      param:   { module: job, action: show }
      requirements:
        id: \d+
        sf_method: [GET]

<propel>
The `doSelectActive()` method will receive the `Criteria` object built by the
route:

    [php]
    // lib/model/JobeetJobPeer.php
    class JobeetJobPeer extends BaseJobeetJobPeer
    {
      static public function doSelectActive(Criteria $criteria)
      {
        $criteria->add(JobeetJobPeer::EXPIRES_AT, time(),
         ➥ Criteria::GREATER_THAN);

        return self::doSelectOne($criteria);
      }

      // ...
    }
</propel>
<doctrine>
The `retrieveActiveJob()` method will receive the `Doctrine_Query` object built
by the route:

    [php]
    // lib/model/doctrine/JobeetJobTable.class.php
    class JobeetJobTable extends Doctrine_Table
    {
      public function retrieveActiveJob(Doctrine_Query $q)
      {
        $q->andWhere('a.expires_at > ?', date('Y-m-d H:i:s', time()));

        return $q->fetchOne();
      }

      // ...
    }
</doctrine>

Now, if you try to get an expired job, you will be forwarded to a 404 page.

Link to the Category Page
-------------------------

Now, let's add a link to the category page on the homepage and create the
category page.

But, wait a minute. the hour is not yet over and we haven't worked that much.
So, you have plenty of free time and enough knowledge to implement this all by
yourself! Let's make an exercise of it. Check back tomorrow for our
implementation.

Final Thoughts
