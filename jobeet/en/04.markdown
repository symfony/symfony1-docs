Day 4: The Controller and the View
==================================

Yesterday, we explored how symfony simplifies database management by
abstracting the differences between database engines, and by converting the
relational elements to nice object oriented classes. We have also played with
##ORM## to describe the database schema, create the tables, and populate the
database with some initial data.

Today, we are going to customize the basic `job` module we created yesterday.
The `job` module already has all the code we need for Jobeet:

 * A page to list all jobs
 * A page to create a new job
 * A page to update an existing job
 * A page to delete a job

Although the code is ready to be used as is, we will refactor the templates to
match closer to the Jobeet mockups.

The ~MVC~ Architecture
----------------------

If you are used to developing PHP websites without a framework, you probably
use the one PHP file per HTML page paradigm. These PHP files probably contain
the same kind of structure: initialization and global configuration, business
logic related to the requested page, database records fetching, and finally
HTML code that builds the page.

You may use a templating engine to separate the logic from the HTML. Perhaps
you use a database abstraction layer to separate model interaction from
business logic. But most of the time, you end up with a lot of code that is a
nightmare to maintain. It was fast to build, but over time, it's more and more
difficult to make changes, especially because nobody except you understands
how it is built and how it works.

As with every problem, there are nice solutions. For web development, the most
common solution for organizing your code nowadays is the
[**MVC design pattern**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller).
In short, the MVC ~design pattern|Design Patterns~ defines a way to organize your
code according to its nature. This pattern separates the code into 
**three layers**:

  * The **~Model~** layer defines the business logic (the database belongs to
    this layer). You already know that symfony stores all the classes and
    files related to the Model in the `lib/model/` directory.

  * The **~View~** is what the user interacts with (a template engine is part
    of this layer). In symfony, the View layer is mainly made of PHP
    templates. They are stored in various `templates/` directories as we will
    see later on today.

  * The **~Controller~** is a piece of code that calls the Model to get some
    data that it passes to the View for rendering to the client. When we
    installed symfony the first day, we saw that all requests are managed by
    front controllers (`index.php` and `frontend_dev.php`). These front
    controllers delegate the real work to **actions**. As we saw yesterday,
    these actions are logically grouped into **modules**.

![MVC](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_4/04/mvc.png)

Today, we will use the mockup defined in day 2 to customize the homepage and
the job page. We will also make them dynamic. Along the way, we will tweak a
lot of things in many different files to demonstrate the symfony directory
structure and the way to separate code between layers.

The Layout
----------

First, if you have a closer look at the mockups, you will notice that much of
each page looks the same. You already know that code duplication is bad,
whether we are talking about HTML or PHP code, so we need to find a way to
prevent these common view elements from resulting in code duplication.

One way to solve the problem is to define a header and a footer and include
them in each template:

![Header and footer](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_4/04/header_footer.png)

But here the header and the footer files do not contain valid HTML. There must
be a better way. Instead of reinventing the wheel, we will use another design
pattern to solve this problem: the
[~decorator|Decorator~ design pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern).
The decorator design pattern resolves the problem the other way around: the
template is decorated after the content is rendered by a global template,
called a **~layout|Layout~** in symfony:

![Layout](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_4/04/layout.png)

The default layout of an application is called `layout.php` and can be found
in the `apps/frontend/templates/` directory. This directory contains all the
global templates for an application.

Replace the default symfony layout with the following code:

    [php]
    <!-- apps/frontend/templates/layout.php -->

A symfony ~template|Templates~ is just a plain PHP file. In the layout
template, you see calls to PHP functions and references to PHP variables.
~`$sf_content`~ is the most interesting variable: it is defined by the
framework itself and contains the HTML generated by the action.

If you browse the `job` module
(`http://jobeet.localhost/frontend_dev.php/job`), you will see that all
actions are now decorated by the layout.

The Stylesheets, Images, and JavaScripts
----------------------------------------

As this tutorial is not about web design, we have already prepared all the
needed assets we will use for Jobeet:
[download the image files](http://www.symfony-project.org/get/jobeet/images.zip)
archive and put them into the `web/images/` directory;
[download the stylesheet files](http://www.symfony-project.org/get/jobeet/css.zip)
archive and put them into the `web/css/` directory.

>**NOTE**
>In the layout, we have included a *favicon*. You can
>[download the Jobeet one](http://www.symfony-project.org/get/jobeet/favicon.ico)
>and put it under the `web/` directory.

![The job module with a layout and assets](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_4/04/job_layout_assets.png)

>**TIP**
>By default, the `generate:project` task has created three directories for the
>project assets: `web/images/` for images, `web/~css|CSS~/` for 
>~stylesheet|Stylesheets~s, and `web/js/` for ~JavaScript~s. This is one of the 
> many ~conventions|Conventions~ defined by symfony, but you can of course store 
>them elsewhere under the `web/` directory.

The astute reader will have noticed that even if the `main.css` file is not
mentioned anywhere in the default layout, it is definitely present in the
generated HTML. But not the other ones. How is this possible?

The stylesheet file has been included by the `include_stylesheets()` function
call found within the layout `<head>` tag. The `include_stylesheets()`
function is called a **helper**. A helper is a function, defined by symfony,
that can take parameters and returns HTML code. Most of the time, helpers are
time-savers, they package code snippets frequently used in templates. The
`include_stylesheets()` helper generates `<link>` tags for stylesheets.

But how does the helper know which stylesheets to include?

The ~View~ layer can be configured by editing the ~`view.yml`~ configuration
file of the application. Here is the default one generated by the
`generate:app` task:

    [yml]
    # apps/frontend/config/view.yml
    default:
      http_metas:
        content-type: text/html

      metas:
        #title:        symfony project
        #description:  symfony project
        #keywords:     symfony, project
        #language:     en
        #robots:       index, follow

      stylesheets:    [main.css]

      javascripts:    []

      has_layout:     true
      layout:         layout

The `view.yml` file configures the `default` settings for all the templates of
the application. For instance, the `stylesheets` entry defines an array of
stylesheet files to include for every page of the application (the inclusion
is done by the `include_stylesheets()` helper).

>**NOTE**
>In the default `view.yml` configuration file, the referenced file is
>`main.css`, and not `/css/main.css`. As a matter of fact, both definitions
>are equivalent as symfony ~prefixes|Prefix~ relative paths with `/~css|CSS~/`.

If many files are defined, symfony will include them in the same order as the
definition:

    [yml]
    stylesheets:    [main.css, jobs.css, job.css]

You can also change the `media` attribute and omit the `.css` suffix:

    [yml]
    stylesheets:    [main.css, jobs.css, job.css, print: { media: print }]

This configuration will be rendered as:

    [php]
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen"
      href="/css/main.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen"
      href="/css/jobs.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen"
      href="/css/job.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="print"
      href="/css/print.css" />

>**TIP**
>The `view.yml` configuration file also defines the default ~layout|Layout~ used by the
>application. By default, the name is `layout`, and so symfony decorates every
>page with the `layout.php` file. You can also disable the decoration process
>altogether by switching the ~`has_layout`~ entry to `false`.

It works as is but the `jobs.css` file is only needed for the homepage and the
`job.css` file is only needed for the job page. The `view.yml` configuration
file can be customized on a per-module basis. Change the stylesheets key of
the application `view.yml` file to only contain the `main.css` file:

    [yml]
    # apps/frontend/config/view.yml
    stylesheets:    [main.css]

To customize the view for the `job` module, create a `view.yml` file in the
`apps/frontend/modules/job/config/` directory:

    [yml]
    # apps/frontend/modules/job/config/view.yml
    indexSuccess:
      stylesheets: [jobs.css]

    showSuccess:
      stylesheets: [job.css]

Under the `indexSuccess` and `showSuccess` sections (they are the template
names associated with the `index` and `show` actions, as we will see later
on), you can customize any entry found under the `default` section of the
application `view.yml`. All specific entries are merged with the application
configuration. You can also define some configuration for all actions of a
module with the special `all` section.

>**SIDEBAR**
>Configuration Principles in symfony
>
>For many symfony ~configuration|Configuration~ files, the same setting can 
>be defined at different levels:
>
>  * The default configuration is located in the framework
>  * The global configuration for the project (in `config/`)
>  * The local configuration for an application (in `apps/APP/config/`)
>  * The local configuration restricted to a module (in
>    `apps/APP/modules/MODULE/config/`)
>
>At runtime, the configuration system merges all the values from the different

As a rule of thumb, when something is configurable via a configuration file,
the same can be accomplished with PHP code. Instead of creating a `view.yml`
file for the `job` module for instance, you can also use the
~`use_stylesheet()` helper~ to include a stylesheet from a template:

    [php]
    <?php use_stylesheet('main.css') ?>

You can also use this helper in the layout to include a stylesheet globally.

Choosing between one method or the other is really a matter of taste. The
`view.yml` file provides a way to define things for all actions of a module,
which is not possible in a template, but the configuration is quite static. On
the other hand, using the `use_stylesheet()` ~helper|Helpers~ is more flexible
and moreover, everything is in the same place: the stylesheet definition and
the HTML code. For Jobeet, we will use the `use_stylesheet()` helper, so you
can remove the `view.yml` we have just created and update the `job` templates
with the `use_stylesheet()` calls:

    [php]
    <!-- apps/frontend/modules/job/templates/indexSuccess.php -->
    <?php use_stylesheet('jobs.css') ?>

    <!-- apps/frontend/modules/job/templates/showSuccess.php -->
    <?php use_stylesheet('job.css') ?>

>**NOTE**
>Symmetrically, the JavaScript configuration is done via the `javascripts`
>entry of the `view.yml` configuration file and the ~`use_javascript()` helper~
>defines JavaScript files to include for a template.

The Job Homepage
----------------

As seen in day 3, the job homepage is generated by the `index` action of the
`job` module. The `index` action is the Controller part of the page and the
associated template, `indexSuccess.php`, is the View part:

    apps/
      frontend/
        modules/
          job/
            actions/
              actions.class.php
            templates/
              indexSuccess.php

### The Action

Each ~action|Action~ is represented by a method of a class. For the job
homepage, the class is `jobActions` (the name of the module suffixed by
`Actions`) and the method is `executeIndex()` (`execute` suffixed by the name
of the action). It retrieves all the jobs from the database:

    [php]
    // apps/frontend/modules/job/actions/actions.class.php
    class jobActions extends sfActions
    {
      public function executeIndex(sfWebRequest $request)
      {
<propel>
        $this->jobeet_jobs = JobeetJobPeer::doSelect(new Criteria());
</propel>
<doctrine>
        $this->jobeet_jobs = Doctrine::getTable('JobeetJob')
          ->createQuery('a')
          ->execute();
</doctrine>
      }

      // ...
    }

<propel>
Let's have a closer look at the code: the `executeIndex()` method (the
Controller) calls the Model `JobeetJobPeer` to retrieve all the jobs
(`new Criteria()`). It returns an array of `JobeetJob` objects that are assigned to
the `jobeet_jobs` object property.
</propel>
<doctrine>
Let's have a closer look at the code: the `executeIndex()` method (the
Controller) calls the Table `JobeetJob` to create a query to retrieve all the
jobs. It returns a `Doctrine_Collection` of `JobeetJob` objects that are assigned to
the `jobeet_jobs` object property.
</doctrine>

All such object properties are then automatically passed to the template (the
View). To pass data from the Controller to the View, just create a new
property:

    [php]
    public function executeFooBar(sfWebRequest $request)
    {
      $this->foo = 'bar';
      $this->bar = array('bar', 'baz');
    }

This code will make `$foo` and `$bar` variables accessible in the template.

### The Template

By default, the ~template|Templates~ name associated with an action is deduced
by symfony thanks to a convention (the action name suffixed by `Success`).

The `indexSuccess.php` template generates an HTML table for all the jobs. Here
is the current template code:

    [php]
    <!-- apps/frontend/modules/job/templates/indexSuccess.php -->
    <?php use_stylesheet('jobs.css') ?>

    <h1>Job List</h1>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Id</th>
          <th>Category</th>
          <th>Type</th>
    <!-- more columns here -->
          <th>Created at</th>
          <th>Updated at</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <?php foreach ($jobeet_jobs as $jobeet_job): ?>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <a href="<?php echo url_for('job/show?id='.$jobeet_job->getId()) ?>">
              <?php echo $jobeet_job->getId() ?>
            </a>
          </td>
          <td><?php echo $jobeet_job->getCategoryId() ?></td>
          <td><?php echo $jobeet_job->getType() ?></td>
    <!-- more columns here -->
          <td><?php echo $jobeet_job->getCreatedAt() ?></td>
          <td><?php echo $jobeet_job->getUpdatedAt() ?></td>
        </tr>
        <?php endforeach; ?>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <a href="<?php echo url_for('job/new') ?>">New</a>

In the template code, the `foreach` iterates through the list of `Job` objects
(`$jobeet_jobs`), and for each job, each column value is output. Remember,
accessing a column value is as simple as calling an accessor method which name
begins with `get` and the ~camelCased|Code Formatting~ column name (for
instance the `getCreatedAt()` method for the `created_at` column).

Let's clean this up a bit to only display a sub-set of the available columns:

    [php]
    <!-- apps/frontend/modules/job/templates/indexSuccess.php -->
    <?php use_stylesheet('jobs.css') ?>

    <div id="jobs">
      <table class="jobs">
        <?php foreach ($jobeet_jobs as $i => $job): ?>
          <tr class="<?php echo fmod($i, 2) ? 'even' : 'odd' ?>">
            <td class="location"><?php echo $job->getLocation() ?></td>
            <td class="position">
              <a href="<?php echo url_for('job/show?id='.$job->getId()) ?>">
                <?php echo $job->getPosition() ?>
              </a>
            </td>
            <td class="company"><?php echo $job->getCompany() ?></td>
          </tr>
        <?php endforeach; ?>
      </table>
    </div>

![Homepage](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_4/04/homepage.png)

The `url_for()` function call in this template is a symfony helper that we
will discuss tomorrow.

The Job Page Template
---------------------

Now let's customize the template of the job page. Open the `showSuccess.php`
file and replace its content with the following code:

    [php]
    <!-- apps/frontend/modules/job/templates/showSuccess.php -->
    <?php use_stylesheet('job.css') ?>
    <?php use_helper('Text') ?>

    <div id="job">
      <h1><?php echo $job->getCompany() ?></h1>
      <h2><?php echo $job->getLocation() ?></h2>
      <h3>
        <?php echo $job->getPosition() ?>
        <small> - <?php echo $job->getType() ?></small>
      </h3>

      <?php if ($job->getLogo()): ?>
        <div class="logo">
          <a href="<?php echo $job->getUrl() ?>">
            <img src="/uploads/jobs/<?php echo $job->getLogo() ?>"
              alt="<?php echo $job->getCompany() ?> logo" />
          </a>
        </div>
      <?php endif; ?>

      <div class="description">
        <?php echo simple_format_text($job->getDescription()) ?>
      </div>

      <h4>How to apply?</h4>

      <p class="how_to_apply"><?php echo $job->getHowToApply() ?></p>

      <div class="meta">
<propel>
        <small>posted on <?php echo $job->getCreatedAt('m/d/Y') ?></small>
</propel>
<doctrine>
        <small>posted on <?php echo $job->getDateTimeObject('created_at')->format('m/d/Y') ?></small>
</doctrine>
      </div>

      <div style="padding: 20px 0">
        <a href="<?php echo url_for('job/edit?id='.$job->getId()) ?>">
          Edit
        </a>
      </div>
    </div>

This template uses the `$job` variable passed by the action to display the job
information. As we have renamed the variable passed to the template from
`$jobeet_job` to `$job`, you need to also make this change in the `show`
action (be careful, there are two occurrences of the variable):

    [php]
    // apps/frontend/modules/job/actions/actions.class.php
    public function executeShow(sfWebRequest $request)
    {
<propel>
      $this->job =
       ➥ JobeetJobPeer::retrieveByPk($request->getParameter('id'));
</propel>
<doctrine>
      $this->job = Doctrine::getTable('JobeetJob')->
       ➥ find($request->getParameter('id'));
</doctrine>
      $this->forward404Unless($this->job);
    }

<propel>
Notice that some Propel ~accessors|Accessors~ take arguments. As we have
defined the `created_at` column as a timestamp, the `getCreatedAt()` accessor
takes a date formatting pattern as its first argument:

    [php]
    $job->getCreatedAt('m/d/Y');
</propel>
<doctrine>
Notice that date columns can be converted to PHP DateTime object instances. As
we have defined the `created_at` column as a timestamp, you can convert the
column value to a DateTime object by using the `getDateTimeObject()` method
and then call the `format()` method which takes a date formatting pattern as
its first argument:

    [php]
    $job->getDateTimeObject('created_at')->format('m/d/Y');
</doctrine>

>**NOTE**
>The job description uses the `simple_format_text()` helper to format it as

![Job page](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_4/04/job.png)

~Slot~s
-------

Right now, the title of all pages is defined in the `<title>` tag of the
layout:

    [php]
    <title>Jobeet - Your best job board</title>

But for the job page, we want to provide more useful information, like the
company name and the job position.

In symfony, when a zone of the layout depends on the template to be displayed,
you need to define a slot:

![Slots](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_4/04/layout_slots.png)

Add a slot to the layout to allow the title to be dynamic:

    [php]
    // apps/frontend/templates/layout.php
    <title><?php include_slot('title') ?></title>

Each slot is defined by a name (`title`) and can be displayed by using the
`~include_slot~()` helper. Now, at the beginning of the `showSuccess.php`
template, use the `slot()` helper to define the content of the slot for the
job page:

    [php]
    // apps/frontend/modules/job/templates/showSuccess.php
    <?php slot(
      'title',
      sprintf('%s is looking for a %s', $job->getCompany(), $job->getPosition()))
    ?>

If the title is complex to generate, the `slot()` helper can also be used with
a block of code:

    [php]
    // apps/frontend/modules/job/templates/showSuccess.php
    <?php slot('title') ?>
      <?php echo sprintf('%s is looking for a %s', $job->getCompany(), $job->getPosition()) ?>
    <?php end_slot(); ?>

For some pages, like the homepage, we just need a generic title. Instead of
repeating the same title over and over again in templates, we can define a
default title in the layout:

    [php]
    // apps/frontend/templates/layout.php
    <title>
      <?php include_slot('title', 'Jobeet - Your best job board') ?>
    </title>

The second argument of the `include_slot()` method is the default value for
the slot if it has not been defined. If the default value is longer or has
some HTML tags, you can also defined it like in the following code:

    [php]
    // apps/frontend/templates/layout.php
    <title>
      <?php if (!include_slot('title')): ?>
        Jobeet - Your best job board
      <?php endif; ?>
    </title>

The `include_slot()` helper returns `true` if the slot has been defined. So,
when you define the `title` slot content in a template, it is used; if not,
the default title is used.

>**TIP**
>We have already seen quite a few helpers beginning with `include_`. These helpers
>output the HTML and in most cases have a `get_` helper counterpart to
>just return the content:
>
>     [php]
>     <?php include_slot('title') ?>
>     <?php echo get_slot('title') ?>
>
>     <?php include_stylesheets() ?>
>     <?php echo get_stylesheets() ?>

The Job Page Action
-------------------

The job page is generated by the `show` action, defined in the `executeShow()`
method of the `job` module:

    [php]
    class jobActions extends sfActions
    {
      public function executeShow(sfWebRequest $request)
      {
<propel>
        $this->job =
         ➥ JobeetJobPeer::retrieveByPk($request->getParameter('id'));
</propel>
<doctrine>
        $this->job = Doctrine::getTable('JobeetJob')->
         ➥ find($request->getParameter('id'));
</doctrine>
        $this->forward404Unless($this->job);
      }

      // ...
    }

<propel>
As in the `index` action, the `JobeetJobPeer` class is used to retrieve a job,
this time by using the `retrieveByPk()` method. The parameter of this method
is the unique identifier of a job, its ~primary key|Primary Key~. The next 
section will explain why the `$request->getParameter('id')` statement returns 
the job primary key.
</propel>
<doctrine>
As in the `index` action, the `JobeetJob` table class is used to retrieve a job,
this time by using the `find()` method. The parameter of this method
is the unique identifier of a job, its ~primary key|Primary Key~. The next 
section will explain why the `$request->getParameter('id')` statement returns 
the job primary key.
</doctrine>

<propel>
>**TIP**
>The generated model classes contain a lot of useful methods to interact with
>the project objects. Take some time to browse the code located in the
>`lib/om/` directory and discover all the power embedded in these classes.
</propel>

If the job does not exist in the database, we want to forward the user to a
~404|404 Error~ page, which is exactly what the `forward404Unless()` method does. It
takes a Boolean as its first argument and, unless it is true, stops the current
flow of execution. As the forward methods stops the execution of the action
right away by throwing a `sfError404Exception`, you don't need to return
afterwards.

As for ~exceptions|Exception Handling~, the page displayed to the user is 
different in the `prod` ~environment|Environments~ and in the `dev` environment:

![404 error in the dev environment](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_4/05/404_dev.png)

![404 error in the prod environment](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_4/05/404_prod.png)

>Before you deploy the Jobeet website to the production server, you will learn
>how to customize the default 404 page.

>**SIDEBAR**
>The "~forward|Action Forwarding~" Methods Family
>
>The `forward404Unless` call is actually equivalent to:
>
>     [php]
>     $this->forward404If(!$this->job);
>
>which is also equivalent to:

>     if (!$this->job)
>     {
>       $this->forward404();

>
>The `forward404()` method itself is just a shortcut for:

>     $this->forward('default', '404');
>
>The `forward()` method forwards to another action of the same application;
>in the previous example, to the `404` action of the `default` module.
>The `default` module is bundled with symfony and provides default actions
>to render 404, secure, and login pages.

The Request and the Response
----------------------------

When you browse to the `/job` or `/job/show/id/1` pages in your browser, your
are initiating a round trip with the web server. The browser is sending a
**~request|HTTP Request~** and the server sends back a **~response|HTTP Response~**.

We have already seen that symfony encapsulates the request in a `sfWebRequest`
object (see the `executeShow()` method signature). And as symfony is an
Object-Oriented framework, the response is also an object, of class
`sfWebResponse`. You can access the response object in an action by calling
`$this->getResponse()`.

These objects provide a lot of convenient methods to access information from
PHP functions and PHP global variables.

>**NOTE**
>Why does symfony wrap existing PHP functionalities? First, because the
>symfony methods are more powerful than their PHP counterpart. Then, because
>when you test an application, it is much more easier to simulate a request or
>a response object than trying to fiddle around with global variables or work
>with PHP functions like `header()` which do too much magic behind the scene.

### The Request

The `sfWebRequest` class wraps the ~`$_SERVER`~, ~`$_COOKIE`~, ~`$_GET`~, ~`$_POST`~, and ~`$_FILES`~ PHP global arrays:

 Method name          | PHP equivalent
 -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------
 `getMethod()`        | `$_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']`
 `getUri()`           | `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']`
 `getReferer()`       | `$_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']`
 `getHost()`          | `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']`
 `getLanguages()`     | `$_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE']`
 `getCharsets()`      | `$_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET']`
 `isXmlHttpRequest()` | `$_SERVER['X_REQUESTED_WITH'] == 'XMLHttpRequest'`
 `getHttpHeader()`    | `$_SERVER`
 `getCookie()`        | `$_COOKIE`
 `isSecure()`         | `$_SERVER['HTTPS']`
 `getFiles()`         | `$_FILES`
 `getGetParameter()`  | `$_GET`
 `getPostParameter()` | `$_POST`
 `getUrlParameter()`  | `$_SERVER['PATH_INFO']`
 `getRemoteAddress()` | `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']`

We have already accessed request parameters by using the `getParameter()`
method. It returns a value from the `$_GET` or `$_POST` global variable, or
from the `~PATH_INFO~` variable.

If you want to ensure that a request parameter comes from a particular one of
these variables, you need use the `getGetParameter()`, `getPostParameter()`,
and `getUrlParameter()` methods respectively.

>**NOTE**
>When you want to restrict an action for a specific ~HTTP method|HTTP Method~, 
>for instance when you want to ensure that a form is submitted as a `POST`, 
>you can use the `isMethod()` method: 
>`$this->forwardUnless($request->isMethod('POST'));`.

### The Response

The `sfWebResponse` class wraps the `~header|HTTP Headers~()` and 
`setraw~cookie|Cookies~()` PHP methods:

 Method name                   | PHP equivalent
 ----------------------------- | ----------------
 `setCookie()`                 | `setrawcookie()`
 `setStatusCode()`             | `header()`
 `setHttpHeader()`             | `header()`
 `setContentType()`            | `header()`
 `addVaryHttpHeader()`         | `header()`
 `addCacheControlHttpHeader()` | `header()`

Of course, the `sfWebResponse` class also provides a way to set the content of
the response (`setContent()`) and send the response to the browser (`send()`).

Earlier today we saw how to manage stylesheets and JavaScripts in both the
`view.yml` file and in templates. In the end, both techniques use the response
object `addStylesheet()` and `addJavascript()` methods.

>**TIP**

>[`sfRequest`](http://www.symfony-project.org/api/1_4/sfRequest), and

Final Thoughts
--------------

In this fourth chapter, we have described some design patterns used by symfony. Hopefully the project directory structure now makes more sense. We have played with templates by manipulating the layout and template files. We have also made them a bit more dynamic thanks to slots and actions.

In the following chapter, we will learn more about the `url_for()` helper we have used today, and the routing sub-framework associated with it.
