Day 3: The ~Data Model~
=======================

Those of you itching to open your text editor and lay down some PHP will be
happy to know today's tutorial will get us into some development. We will
define the Jobeet data model, use an ORM to interact with the database, and
build the first module of the application. But as symfony does a lot of the
work for us, we will have a fully functional web module without writing too
much PHP code.

The Relational ~Model~
----------------------

The user stories we have written yesterday describe the main objects of our
project: jobs, affiliates, and categories. Here is the corresponding entity
relationship diagram:

![Entity relationship diagram](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_4/03/diagram.png)

In addition to the columns described in the stories, we have also added a
`created_at` field to some tables. Symfony recognizes such fields and sets the
value to the current system time when a record is created. That's the same for
`updated_at` fields: Their value is set to the system time whenever the record
is updated.

The ~Schema~
------------

To store the jobs, affiliates, and categories, we obviously need a relational
database.

But as symfony is an Object-Oriented framework, we like to manipulate ~object|OOP~s
whenever we can. For example, instead of writing SQL statements to retrieve
records from the database, we'd rather prefer to use objects.

The relational database information must be mapped to an object model. This
can be done with an [ORM tool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping)
and thankfully, symfony comes bundled with two of them:
[Propel](http://propel.phpdb.org/) and [Doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/).
In this tutorial, we will use ##ORM##.

The ORM needs a description of the tables and their relationships to create
the related classes. There are two ways to create this description schema:
by introspecting an existing database or by creating it by hand.

<propel>
>**Note**
>Some tools allow you to build a database graphically
>(for instance [Fabforce's Dbdesigner](http://www.fabforce.net/dbdesigner4/))
>and generate directly a `schema.xml` (with [DB Designer 4 TO Propel Schema
>Converter](http://blog.tooleshed.com/docs/dbd2propel/transform.php)).

As the database does not exist yet and as we want to keep Jobeet database
agnostic, let's create the schema file by hand by editing the empty
~`config/schema.yml`|Database Schema~ file:

    [yml]
    # config/schema.yml
    propel:
      jobeet_category:
        id:           ~
        name:         { type: varchar(255), required: true, index: unique }

      jobeet_job:
        id:           ~
        category_id:  { type: integer, foreignTable: jobeet_category,
          ➥ foreignReference: id, required: true }
        type:         { type: varchar(255) }
        company:      { type: varchar(255), required: true }
        logo:         { type: varchar(255) }
        url:          { type: varchar(255) }
        position:     { type: varchar(255), required: true }
        location:     { type: varchar(255), required: true }
        description:  { type: longvarchar, required: true }
        how_to_apply: { type: longvarchar, required: true }
        token:        { type: varchar(255), required: true, index: unique }
        is_public:    { type: boolean, required: true, default: 1 }
        is_activated: { type: boolean, required: true, default: 0 }
        email:        { type: varchar(255), required: true }
        expires_at:   { type: timestamp, required: true }
        created_at:   ~
        updated_at:   ~

      jobeet_affiliate:
        id:           ~
        url:          { type: varchar(255), required: true }
        email:        { type: varchar(255), required: true, index: unique }
        token:        { type: varchar(255), required: true }
        is_active:    { type: boolean, required: true, default: 0 }
        created_at:   ~

      jobeet_category_affiliate:
        category_id:  { type: integer, foreignTable: jobeet_category,
          ➥ foreignReference: id, required: true, primaryKey: true,
          ➥ onDelete: cascade }
        affiliate_id: { type: integer, foreignTable: jobeet_affiliate,
          ➥ foreignReference: id, required: true, primaryKey: true,
          ➥ onDelete: cascade }
</propel>
<doctrine>
As the database does not exist yet and as we want to keep Jobeet database
agnostic, let's create the schema file by hand by editing the empty
`config/doctrine/schema.yml` file:

    [yml]
    # config/doctrine/schema.yml
    JobeetCategory:
      actAs: { Timestampable: ~ }
      columns:
        name: { type: string(255), notnull: true, unique: true }

    JobeetJob:
      actAs: { Timestampable: ~ }
      columns:
        category_id:  { type: integer, notnull: true }
        type:         { type: string(255) }
        company:      { type: string(255), notnull: true }
        logo:         { type: string(255) }
        url:          { type: string(255) }
        position:     { type: string(255), notnull: true }
        location:     { type: string(255), notnull: true }
        description:  { type: string(4000), notnull: true }
        how_to_apply: { type: string(4000), notnull: true }
        token:        { type: string(255), notnull: true, unique: true }
        is_public:    { type: boolean, notnull: true, default: 1 }
        is_activated: { type: boolean, notnull: true, default: 0 }
        email:        { type: string(255), notnull: true }
        expires_at:   { type: timestamp, notnull: true }
      relations:
        JobeetCategory: { onDelete: CASCADE, local: category_id, foreign: id, foreignAlias: JobeetJobs } 

    JobeetAffiliate:
      actAs: { Timestampable: ~ }
      columns:
        url:       { type: string(255), notnull: true }
        email:     { type: string(255), notnull: true, unique: true }
        token:     { type: string(255), notnull: true }
        is_active: { type: boolean, notnull: true, default: 0 }
      relations:
        JobeetCategories:
          class: JobeetCategory
          refClass: JobeetCategoryAffiliate
          local: affiliate_id
          foreign: category_id
          foreignAlias: JobeetAffiliates

    JobeetCategoryAffiliate:
      columns:
        category_id:  { type: integer, primary: true }
        affiliate_id: { type: integer, primary: true }
      relations:
        JobeetCategory:  { onDelete: CASCADE, local: category_id, foreign: id }
        JobeetAffiliate: { onDelete: CASCADE, local: affiliate_id, foreign: id }
</doctrine>

>**TIP**
>If you have decided to create the tables by writing SQL statements, you can
>generate the corresponding `schema.yml` configuration file by running the
>`propel:build-schema` task:
>
>     $ php symfony propel:build-schema
>
>The above task requires that you have a configured database in `databases.yml`.
>We show you how to configure the database in a later step. If you try and run this

The schema is the direct translation of the entity relationship diagram in
the YAML format.

>**SIDEBAR**
>The ~YAML~ Format
>
>According to the official [YAML](http://yaml.org/) website, YAML is
>"a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages"
>
>Put another way, YAML is a simple language to describe data (strings,
>integers, dates, arrays, and hashes).
>
>In YAML, structure is shown through indentation, sequence items are denoted by
>a dash, and key/value pairs within a map are separated by a colon. YAML also
>has a shorthand syntax to describe the same structure with fewer lines, where
>arrays are explicitly shown with `[]` and hashes with `{}`.
>
>If you are not yet familiar with YAML, it is time to get started as the symfony
>framework uses it extensively for its configuration files. A good starting point
>is the symfony YAML component
>[documentation](http://components.symfony-project.org/yaml/documentation).
>
>There is one important thing you need to remember when editing a YAML file:
>**indentation must be done with one or more spaces, but never with
>~tabulations|Code Formatting~**.

The `schema.yml` file contains the description of all tables and their columns.
Each column is described with the following information:

<propel>
  * `type`: The column type (`boolean`, `tinyint`, `smallint`, `integer`,
    `bigint`, `double`, `float`, `real`, `decimal`, `char`, `varchar(size)`,
    `longvarchar`, `date`, `time`, `timestamp`, `blob`, and `clob`)
  * `required`: Set it to `true` if you want the column to be required
  * `~index|Database indexes~`: Set it to `true` if you want to create an index 
    for the column or to `unique` if you want a unique index to be created on 
    the column.
  * `primaryKey`: Define a column as the ~primary key|Primary Key~ for the table.
  * `foreignTable`, `foreignReference`: Define a column to be a 
    ~foreign key|Foreign Key~ to another table.

For columns set to `~`, which means `null` in YAML (`id`, `created_at`, and
`updated_at`), symfony will guess the best configuration (primary key for `id`
and timestamp for `created_at` and `updated_at`).

>**NOTE**
>The `onDelete` attribute defines the `ON DELETE` 
>~behavior|Integrity constraints~ of foreign keys,
>and Propel supports `CASCADE`, `SETNULL`, and `RESTRICT`. For instance, when
>a `job` record is deleted, all the `jobeet_category_affiliate` related
>records will be automatically deleted by the database or by Propel if the
>underlying engine does not support this functionality.
</propel>
<doctrine>
  * `type`: The ~column type~ (`boolean`, `integer`, `float`, `decimal`,
            `string`, `array`, `object`, `blob`, `clob`, `timestamp`,
            `time`, `date`, `enum`, `gzip`)
  * `notnull`: Set it to `true` if you want the column to be required
  * `unique`: Set it to `true` if you want to create a unique index for the column.

>**NOTE**
>The `onDelete` attribute defines the `ON DELETE` behavior of foreign keys,

</doctrine>

The ~Database~
--------------

The symfony framework supports all PDO-supported databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL,
SQLite, Oracle, MSSQL, ...). [~PDO~](http://www.php.net/PDO) 
is the ~database abstraction layer|Database Abstraction Layer~ bundled with PHP.

Let's use ~MySQL~ for this tutorial:

    $ mysqladmin -uroot -p create jobeet
    Enter password: mYsEcret ## The password will echo as ********

>**Note**
>Feel free to choose another ~database engine|Database Engine~ if you want. It
>won't be difficult to adapt the code we will write as we will use the ORM will
>write the SQL for us.

We need to tell symfony to use this database for the Jobeet project:

    $ php symfony configure:database
      ➥ "mysql:host=localhost;dbname=jobeet" root mYsEcret

The `configure:database` task takes three arguments: the
[~PDO DSN~](http://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.drivers.php), the username, and
the password to access the database. If you don't need a password to access
your database on the development server, just omit the third argument.

>**NOTE**
>The `configure:database` ~task|Tasks~ stores the
>~database configuration|Database Configuration~ into the
>`config/databases.yml` configuration file. Instead of using the task, you can
>edit this file by hand.

-

>**CAUTION**
>Passing the database password on the command line is convenient but
>[~insecure|Security~](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/password-security.html).
>Depending on who has access to your environment, it might be better to
>edit the `config/databases.yml` to change the password. Of course, to
>keep the password safe, the configuration file access mode should also
>be restricted.

The ~ORM~
---------

Thanks to the database description from the `schema.yml` file, we can use some
##ORM## built-in tasks to generate the ~SQL~ statements needed to create the
database tables:

<doctrine>
First in order to generate the SQL you must build your models from your schema
files.

    $ php symfony doctrine:build --model

Now that your models are present you can generate and insert the SQL.
</doctrine>

    $ php symfony propel:build-sql

The `propel:build-sql` task generates SQL statements in the `data/sql/`
directory, optimized for the database engine we have configured:

<propel>
    [sql]
    # snippet from data/sql/lib.model.schema.sql
    CREATE TABLE `jobeet_category`
    (
            `id` INTEGER  NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
            `name` VARCHAR(255)  NOT NULL,
            PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
            UNIQUE KEY `jobeet_category_U_1` (`name`)
    )Type=InnoDB;
</propel>
<doctrine>
    [sql]
    # snippet from data/sql/schema.sql
    CREATE TABLE jobeet_category (id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT, name VARCHAR(255)
    NOT NULL COMMENT 'test', created_at DATETIME, updated_at DATETIME, slug
    VARCHAR(255), UNIQUE INDEX sluggable_idx (slug), PRIMARY KEY(id))
    ENGINE = INNODB;
</doctrine>

To actually create the tables in the database, you need to run the
`propel:insert-sql` task:

    $ php symfony propel:insert-sql

As the task drops the current tables before re-creating them, you are
required to confirm the operation. You can also add the `--no-confirmation`
option to bypass the question, which is useful if you want to run the task
from within a non-interactive batch:

    $ php symfony propel:insert-sql --no-confirmation

>**TIP**
>As for any ~command line|Command Line~ tool, symfony tasks can take arguments
>and options.
>Each task comes with a built-in help message that can be displayed by running
>the `help` task:
>
>     $ php symfony help propel:insert-sql
>
>The help message lists all the possible arguments and options, gives the
>default values for each of them, and provides some useful usage examples.

The ORM also generates PHP classes that map table records to objects:

    $ php symfony propel:build-model

The `propel:build-model` task generates PHP files in the `lib/model/`
directory that can be used to interact with the database.

<propel>
By browsing the generated files, you have probably noticed that Propel
generates four classes per ~table|Table (Database)~. For the `jobeet_job` 
table:

  * `JobeetJob`: An object of this class **represents a single 
                 ~record|Database Record~** of the `jobeet_job` table. The 
                 class is empty by default.
  * `BaseJobeetJob`: The parent class of `JobeetJob`. Each time you run
                     `propel:build-model`, this class is overwritten, so all
                     customizations must be done in the `JobeetJob` class.

  * `JobeetJobPeer`: The class defines static methods that mostly **return
                     collections** of `JobeetJob` objects. The class is empty
                     by default.
  * `BaseJobeetJobPeer`: The parent class of `JobeetJobPeer`. Each time you
                         run `propel:build-model`, this class is overwritten,
                         so all customizations must be done in the
                         `JobeetJobPeer` class.
</propel>
<doctrine>
By browsing the generated files, you have probably noticed that Doctrine
generates three classes per table. For the `jobeet_job` table:

 * `JobeetJob`: An object of this class represents a single record of the
                `jobeet_job` table. The class is empty by default.
 * `BaseJobeetJob`: The parent class of `JobeetJob`. Each time you run
                    `doctrine:build --model`, this class is overwritten, so all
                    ~customizations|Customization~ must be done in the 
                    `JobeetJob` class.

 * `JobeetJobTable`: The class defines methods that mostly return
                    collections of `JobeetJob` objects. The class is empty by
                    default.
</doctrine>

The column values of a record can be manipulated with a model object by using
some ~accessors|Accessors~ (`get*()` methods) and mutators (`set*()` methods):

    [php]
    $job = new JobeetJob();
    $job->setPosition('Web developer');
    $job->save();

    echo $job->getPosition();

    $job->delete();

You can also define ~foreign keys|Foreign Key~ directly by linking objects
together:

    [php]
    $category = new JobeetCategory();
    $category->setName('Programming');

    $job = new JobeetJob();
    $job->setCategory($category);

The `propel:build-all` task is a shortcut for the tasks we have run in this
section and some more. So, run this task now to generate forms and validators
for the Jobeet model classes:

    $ php symfony propel:build-all --no-confirmation

You will see validators in action at the end of the day and forms will be
explained in great details on day 10.

>**TIP**
>A symfony ~task|Tasks~ is made of a namespace and a task name. Each one can be
>shortened as much as there is no ambiguity with other tasks. So, the following
>commands are equivalent to `propel:build-model`:
>
>     $ php symfony propel:build-mo
<propel>
>     $ php symfony pro:build-mo
</propel>
<doctrine>
>     $ php symfony doc:build-mo
</doctrine>

The Initial Data
----------------

The tables have been created in the database but there is no data in them.
For any web application, there are three types of data:

  * **Initial data**: Initial data are needed for the application to work. For
                      example, Jobeet needs some initial categories. If not,
                      nobody will be able to submit a job. We also need an
                      admin user to be able to login to the backend.

  * **Test data**: ~Test Data~ are needed for the application to be tested. As a
                   developer, you will write tests to ensure that Jobeet
                   behaves as described in the user stories, and the best way
                   is to write automated tests. So, each time you run your
                   tests, you need a clean database with some fresh data to
                   test on.

  * **User data**: User data are created by the users during the normal life
                   of the application.

Each time symfony creates the tables in the database, all the data are lost.
To populate the database with some initial data, we could create a PHP script,
or execute some SQL statements with the `mysql` program. But as the need is
quite common, there is a better way with symfony: create YAML files in the
`data/fixtures/` directory and use the `propel:data-load` task to load them
into the database.

First, create the following ~fixture|Fixtures~ files:

<propel>
    [yml]
    # data/fixtures/010_categories.yml
    JobeetCategory:
      design:        { name: Design }
      programming:   { name: Programming }

A fixtures file is written in YAML, and defines model objects, labelled with a
unique name (for instance, we have defined two jobs labelled `job_sensio_labs`
and `job_extreme_sensio`). This label is of great use to link related objects
without having to define ~primary keys|Primary Key~ (which are often
auto-incremented and cannot be set). For instance, the `job_sensio_labs` job
category is `programming`, which is the label given to the 'Programming'
category.

>**TIP**
>In a YAML file, when a string contains line breaks (like the `description`
>column in the job fixture file), you can use the pipe (`|`) to indicate that
>the string will span several lines.

Although a fixture file can contain objects from one or several models, we
have decided to create one file per model for the Jobeet fixtures.

<propel>
>**TIP**

</propel>
<doctrine>
>**NOTE**
>Propel requires that the fixtures files be prefixed with numbers to determine
>the order in which the files will be loaded. With Doctrine this is not required
>as all fixtures will be loaded and saved in the correct order to make sure

</doctrine>

In a fixture file, you don't need to define all columns values. If not,
symfony will use the default value defined in the database schema. And as
symfony uses ##ORM## to load the data into the database, all the built-in
~behaviors|Behaviors (ORM)~ (like automatically setting the `created_at` or
`updated_at` columns) and the custom behaviors you might have added to the
model classes are activated.

Loading the initial data into the database is as simple as running the
`propel:data-load` task:

    $ php symfony propel:data-load

>**TIP**
>The `propel:build-all-load` task is a shortcut for the `propel:build-all` task
>followed by the `propel:data-load` task.

<doctrine>
Run the `doctrine:build --all --and-load` task to make sure everything is generated
from your schema. This will generate your forms, filters, models, drop your
database and re-create it with all the tables.

    $ php symfony doctrine:build --all --and-load
</doctrine>

See it in Action in the Browser
-------------------------------

We have used the command line interface a lot but that's not really exciting,
especially for a web project. We now have everything we need to create Web
pages that interact with the database.

Let's see how to display the list of jobs, how to edit an existing job, and
how to delete a job. As explained during day 1, a symfony project is made of
applications. Each ~application|Application~ is further divided into
**modules**. A ~module|Module~ is a self-contained set of PHP code that
represents a feature of the application (the API module for example), or a set
of manipulations the user can do on a model object (a job module for example).

Symfony is able to automatically generate a module for a given model that
provides basic manipulation features:

    $ php symfony propel:generate-module --with-show
      ➥ --non-verbose-templates frontend job JobeetJob

The `propel:generate-module` generates a `job` module in the `frontend`
application for the `JobeetJob` model. As with most symfony tasks, some files
and directories have been created for you under the
`apps/frontend/modules/job/` directory:

 | Directory    | Description
 | ------------ | --------------------
 | `actions/`   | The module actions
 | `templates/` | The module templates

The `actions/actions.class.php` file defines all the available
**~action|Action~** for the `job` module:

 | Action name    | Description
 | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------
 | `index`        | Displays the records of the table
 | `show`         | Displays the fields and their values for a given record
 | `new`          | Displays a form to create a new record
 | `create`       | Creates a new record
 | `edit`         | Displays a form to edit an existing record
 | `update`       | Updates a record according to the user submitted values
 | `delete`       | Deletes a given record from the table

You can now test the job module in a browser:

     http://jobeet.localhost/frontend_dev.php/job

![Job module](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_4/03/job.png)

<propel>
If you try to edit a job, you will have an exception because symfony needs a
text representation of a category. A PHP object representation can be defined
with the PHP `__toString()` magic method. The text representation of a category
record should be defined in the `JobeetCategory` model class:

    [php]
    // lib/model/JobeetCategory.php
    class JobeetCategory extends BaseJobeetCategory
    {
      public function __toString()
      {
        return $this->getName();
      }
    }

Now each time symfony needs a text representation of a category, it calls the
~`__toString()`~ method which returns the category name. As we will need a
text representation of all model classes at one point or another, let's define
a `__toString()` method for every model class:
</propel>
<doctrine>
If you try to edit a job, you will notice the Category id drop down has a list
of all the category names. The value of each option is gotten from the
`__toString()` method.

Doctrine will try and provide a base ~`__toString()`~ method by guessing a
descriptive column name like, `title`, `name`, `subject`, etc. If you want
something custom then you will need to add your own `__toString()` methods
like below. The `JobeetCategory` model is able to guess the `__toString()`
method by using the `name` column of the `jobeet_category` table.
</doctrine>

    [php]
<propel>
    // lib/model/JobeetJob.php
</propel>
<doctrine>
    // lib/model/doctrine/JobeetJob.class.php
</doctrine>
    class JobeetJob extends BaseJobeetJob
    {
      public function __toString()
      {
        return sprintf('%s at %s (%s)', $this->getPosition(),
         ➥ $this->getCompany(), $this->getLocation());
      }
    }

<propel>
    // lib/model/JobeetAffiliate.php
</propel>
<doctrine>
    // lib/model/doctrine/JobeetAffiliate.class.php
</doctrine>
    class JobeetAffiliate extends BaseJobeetAffiliate
    {
      public function __toString()
      {
        return $this->getUrl();
      }
    }

You can now create and edit jobs. Try to leave a required field blank, or try
to enter an invalid date. That's right, symfony has created basic validation
rules by introspecting the database schema.

See you Tomorrow
----------------

That's all for today. I have warned you in the introduction. Today, we have
barely written PHP code but we have a working web module for the job model,
ready to be tweaked and customized. Remember, no PHP code also means no bugs!

If you still have some energy left, feel free to read the generated code for
the module and the model and try to understand how it works. If not, don't
worry and sleep well, as tomorrow, we will talk about one of the most used
paradigm in web frameworks, the
[MVC design pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller).

As for any other day, today's code is available on the Jobeet SVN repository.
Checkout the `release_day_03` tag:

    $ svn co http://svn.jobeet.org/##ORM_LOWER##/tags/release_day_03/ jobeet/
