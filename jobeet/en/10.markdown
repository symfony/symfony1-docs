Day 10: The Forms
=================

Previous day of this Jobeet tutorial got off to a flying start with the
introduction of the symfony test framework. We will continue today with the form
framework.

The Form Framework
------------------

Any website has ~forms|Forms~; from the simple contact form to the complex ones
with lots of fields. Writing forms is also one of the most complex and tedious
task for a web developer: you need to write the HTML form, implement validation
rules for each field, process the values to store them in a database, display
error messages, repopulate fields in case of errors, and much more...

Of course, instead of reinventing the wheel over and over again, symfony
provides a framework to ease form management. The form framework is made of
three parts:

  * **validation**: The ~validation|Validation~ sub-framework provides classes 
                    to validate inputs (integer, string, email address, ...)

  * **widgets**:    The ~widget|Widgets~ sub-framework provides classes to 
                    output HTML fields (input, textarea, select, ...)

  * **forms**:      The ~form|Forms~ classes represent forms made of widgets and
                    validators and provide methods to help manage the form.
                    Each form field has its own validator and widget.

Forms
-----

A symfony form is a class made of fields. Each field has a name, a
~validator|Validators~, and a ~widget|Widgets~. A simple `ContactForm` can be
defined with the following class:

    [php]
    class ContactForm extends sfForm
    {
      public function configure()
      {
        $this->setWidgets(array(
          'email'   => new sfWidgetFormInputText(),
          'message' => new sfWidgetFormTextarea(),
        ));

        $this->setValidators(array(
          'email'   => new sfValidatorEmail(),
          'message' => new sfValidatorString(array('max_length' => 255)),
        ));
      }
    }

Form fields are configured in the `configure()` method, by using the
`setValidators()` and `setWidgets()` methods.

>**TIP**
>The form framework comes bundled with a lot of
>[widgets](http://www.symfony-project.org/api/1_4/widget) and
>[validators](http://www.symfony-project.org/api/1_4/validator). The API
>describes them quite extensively with all the options, errors, and default
>error messages.

The widget and validator class names are quite explicit: the `email` field will
be rendered as an HTML `<input>` tag (`sfWidgetFormInputText`) and validated as
an email address (`sfValidatorEmail`). The `message` field will be rendered as a
`<textarea>` tag (`sfWidgetFormTextarea`), and must be a string of no more than
255 characters (`sfValidatorString`).

By default all fields are ~required|Required Form Fields~, as the default value
for the `required` option is `true`. So, the validation definition for `email`
is equivalent to `new sfValidatorEmail(array('required' => true))`.

>**TIP**
>You can merge a form in another one by using the `mergeForm()` method, or
>embed one by using the `embedForm()` method:
>
>     [php]
>     $this->mergeForm(new AnotherForm());
>     $this->embedForm('name', new AnotherForm());

##ORM## Forms
-------------

Most of the time, a form has to be serialized to the database. As symfony
already knows everything about your database model, it can automatically
generate forms based on this information. In fact, when you launched the
`propel:build --all` task during day 3, symfony automatically called the
`propel:build --forms` task:

    $ php symfony propel:build --forms

The `propel:build --forms` task generates form classes in the `lib/form/`
directory. The organization of these generated files is similar to that of
`lib/model/`. Each model class has a related form class (for instance
`JobeetJob` has `JobeetJobForm`), which is empty by default as it inherits from
a base class:

    [php]
<propel>
    // lib/form/JobeetJobForm.class.php
</propel>
<doctrine>
    // lib/form/doctrine/JobeetJobForm.class.php
</doctrine>
    class JobeetJobForm extends BaseJobeetJobForm
    {
      public function configure()
      {
      }
    }

<propel>
>**TIP**
>By browsing the generated files under the `lib/form/base/` sub-directory, you
>will see a lot of great usage examples of symfony built-in widgets and
>validators.
</propel>
<doctrine>
>**TIP**
>By browsing the generated files under the `lib/form/doctrine/base/`
>sub-directory, you will see a lot of great usage examples of symfony built-in
>widgets and validators.
</doctrine>

### Customizing the Job Form

The job form is a perfect example to learn ~form customization|Forms
(Customization)~. Let's see how to customize it, step by step.

First, change the "Post a Job" link in the layout to be able to check changes
directly in your browser:

    [php]
    <!-- apps/frontend/templates/layout.php -->
    <a href="<?php echo url_for('job_new') ?>">Post a Job</a>

By default, a ##ORM## form displays fields for all the table columns. But for
the job form, some of them must not be editable by the end user. Removing fields
from a form is as simple as unsetting them:

    [php]
<propel>
    // lib/form/JobeetJobForm.class.php
</propel>
<doctrine>
    // lib/form/doctrine/JobeetJobForm.class.php
</doctrine>
    class JobeetJobForm extends BaseJobeetJobForm
    {
      public function configure()
      {
        unset(
          $this['created_at'], $this['updated_at'],
          $this['expires_at'], $this['is_activated']
        );
      }
    }

Unsetting a field means that both the field widget and validator are removed.

Instead of unsetting the fields you don't want to display, you can also
explicitly list the fields you want by using the `useFields()` method:

    [php]
    <propel>
        // lib/form/JobeetJobForm.class.php
    </propel>
    <doctrine>
        // lib/form/doctrine/JobeetJobForm.class.php
    </doctrine>
        class JobeetJobForm extends BaseJobeetJobForm
        {
          public function configure()
          {
            $this->useFields(array('category_id', 'type', 'company', 'logo',
              ➥ 'url', 'position', 'location', 'description', 'how_to_apply',
              ➥ 'token', 'is_public', 'email'));
          }
        }

The `useFields()` method does two things automatically for you: it adds the
hidden fields and the array of fields is used to change the fields order.

>**TIP**
>Explicitly listing the form fields you want to display means that when adding
>new fields to a base form, they won't automagically appear in your form
>(think of a model form where you add a new column to the related table).

The form configuration must sometimes be more precise than what can be
introspected from the database schema. For example, the `email` column is a
`varchar` in the schema, but we need this column to be validated as an email.
Let's change the default `sfValidatorString` to a `sfValidatorEmail`:

    [php]
<propel>
    // lib/form/JobeetJobForm.class.php
</propel>
<doctrine>
    // lib/form/doctrine/JobeetJobForm.class.php
</doctrine>
    public function configure()
    {
      // ...

      $this->validatorSchema['email'] = new sfValidatorEmail();
    }

Replacing the default validator is not always the best solution, as the default
validation rules introspected from the database schema are lost (`new
sfValidatorString(array('max_length' => 255))`). It is almost always better to
add the new validator to the existing ones by using the special `sfValidatorAnd`
validator:

    [php]
<propel>
    // lib/form/JobeetJobForm.class.php
</propel>
<doctrine>
    // lib/form/doctrine/JobeetJobForm.class.php
</doctrine>
    public function configure()
    {
      // ...

      $this->validatorSchema['email'] = new sfValidatorAnd(array(
        $this->validatorSchema['email'],
        new sfValidatorEmail(),
      ));
    }

The `sfValidatorAnd` validator takes an array of validators that must pass for
the value to be valid. The trick here is to reference the current validator
(`$this->validatorSchema['email']`), and to add the new one.

>**NOTE**
>You can also use the `sfValidatorOr` validator to force a value to
>pass at least one validator. And of course, you can mix and match
>`sfValidatorAnd` and `sfValidatorOr` validators to create complex
>boolean based validators.

Even if the `type` column is also a `varchar` in the schema, we want its value
to be restricted to a list of choices: full time, part time, or freelance.

<propel>
First, let's define the possible values in `JobeetJobPeer`:

    [php]
    // lib/model/JobeetJobPeer.php
    class JobeetJobPeer extends BaseJobeetJobPeer
    {
      static public $types = array(
        'full-time' => 'Full time',
        'part-time' => 'Part time',
        'freelance' => 'Freelance',
      );

      // ...
    }
</propel>
<doctrine>
First, let's define the possible values in `JobeetJobTable`:

    [php]
    // lib/model/doctrine/JobeetJobTable.class.php
    class JobeetJobTable extends Doctrine_Table
    {
      static public $types = array(
        'full-time' => 'Full time',
        'part-time' => 'Part time',
        'freelance' => 'Freelance',
      );

      public function getTypes()
      {
        return self::$types;
      }

      // ...
    }
</doctrine>

Then, use `sfWidgetFormChoice` for the `type` widget:

    [php]
    $this->widgetSchema['type'] = new sfWidgetFormChoice(array(
<propel>
      'choices'  => JobeetJobPeer::$types,
</propel>
<doctrine>
      'choices'  => Doctrine_Core::getTable('JobeetJob')->getTypes(),
</doctrine>
      'expanded' => true,
    ));

`sfWidgetFormChoice` represents a ~choice widget~ which can be rendered by a
different widget according to some configuration options (`expanded` and
`multiple`):

 * Dropdown list (`<select>`): `array('multiple' => false, 'expanded' => false)`
 * Dropdown box (`<select multiple="multiple">`): `array('multiple' => true, 'expanded' => false)`
 * List of radio buttons: `array('multiple' => false, 'expanded' => true)`
 * List of checkboxes: `array('multiple' => true, 'expanded' => true)`

>**NOTE**
>If you want one of the radio button to be selected by default (`full-time`
>for instance), you can change the default value in the database schema.

Even if you think nobody can submit a non-valid value, a hacker can easily
bypass the widget choices by using tools like [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) or
the [Firefox Web Developer Toolbar](http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/). Let's change the
validator to restrict the possible choices:

<propel>
    [php]
    $this->validatorSchema['type'] = new sfValidatorChoice(array(
      'choices' => array_keys(JobeetJobPeer::$types),
    ));
</propel>
<doctrine>
    [php]
    $this->validatorSchema['type'] = new sfValidatorChoice(array(
      'choices' => array_keys(Doctrine_Core::getTable('JobeetJob')->getTypes()),
    ));
</doctrine>

As the `logo` column will store the filename of the logo associated with the
job, we need to change the widget to a ~file input|File Input~ tag:

    [php]
    $this->widgetSchema['logo'] = new sfWidgetFormInputFile(array(
      'label' => 'Company logo',
    ));

For each field, symfony automatically generates a ~label|Form Labels~ (which
will be used in the rendered `<label>` tag). This can be changed with the
`label` option.

You can also change labels in a batch with the `setLabels()` method of the
widget array:

    [php]
    $this->widgetSchema->setLabels(array(
      'category_id'    => 'Category',
      'is_public'      => 'Public?',
      'how_to_apply'   => 'How to apply?',
    ));

We also need to change the default validator:

    [php]
    $this->validatorSchema['logo'] = new sfValidatorFile(array(
      'required'   => false,
      'path'       => sfConfig::get('sf_upload_dir').'/jobs',
      'mime_types' => 'web_images',
    ));

`sfValidatorFile` is quite interesting as it does a number of things:

 * Validates that the uploaded file is an image in a web format (`mime_types`)
 * Renames the file to something unique
 * Stores the file in the given `path`
 * Updates the `logo` column with the generated name

>**NOTE**
>You need to create the logo directory (`web/uploads/jobs/`) and check that it
>is writable by the web server.

As the validator will save the relative path in the database, change the path
used in the `showSuccess` template:

    [php]
    // apps/frontend/modules/job/templates/showSuccess.php
    <img src="/uploads/jobs/<?php echo $job->getLogo() ?>" alt="<?php echo $job->getCompany() ?> logo" />

>**TIP**
>If a `generateLogoFilename()` method exists in the model, it will be called
>by the validator and the result will override the default generated `logo`
>filename. The method takes the `sfValidatedFile` object as an argument.

Just as you can override the generated label of any field, you can also define a
~help message|Forms (Help)~. Let's add one for the `is_public` column to better
explain its significance:

    [php]
    $this->widgetSchema->setHelp('is_public', 'Whether the job can also be published on affiliate websites or not.');

The final `JobeetJobForm` class reads as follows:

    [php]
<propel>
    // lib/form/JobeetJobForm.class.php
</propel>
<doctrine>
    // lib/form/doctrine/JobeetJobForm.class.php
</doctrine>
    class JobeetJobForm extends BaseJobeetJobForm
    {
      public function configure()
      {
        unset(
          $this['created_at'], $this['updated_at'],
          $this['expires_at'], $this['is_activated']
        );

        $this->validatorSchema['email'] = new sfValidatorAnd(array(
          $this->validatorSchema['email'],
          new sfValidatorEmail(),
        ));

        $this->widgetSchema['type'] = new sfWidgetFormChoice(array(
<propel>
          'choices' => JobeetJobPeer::$types,
</propel>
<doctrine>
          'choices'  => Doctrine_Core::getTable('JobeetJob')->getTypes(),
</doctrine>
          'expanded' => true,
        ));
        $this->validatorSchema['type'] = new sfValidatorChoice(array(
<propel>
          'choices' => array_keys(JobeetJobPeer::$types),
</propel>
<doctrine>
          'choices' => array_keys(Doctrine_Core::getTable('JobeetJob')->getTypes()),
</doctrine>
        ));

        $this->widgetSchema['logo'] = new sfWidgetFormInputFile(array(
          'label' => 'Company logo',
        ));

        $this->widgetSchema->setLabels(array(
          'category_id'    => 'Category',
          'is_public'      => 'Public?',
          'how_to_apply'   => 'How to apply?',
        ));

        $this->validatorSchema['logo'] = new sfValidatorFile(array(
          'required'   => false,
          'path'       => sfConfig::get('sf_upload_dir').'/jobs',
          'mime_types' => 'web_images',
        ));

        $this->widgetSchema->setHelp('is_public', 'Whether the job can also be published on affiliate websites or not.');
      }
    }

### The Form Template

Now that the form class has been customized, we need to display it. The
~template|Templates~ for the form is the same whether you want to create a new
job or edit an existing one. In fact, both `newSuccess.php` and
`editSuccess.php` templates are quite similar:

    [php]
    <!-- apps/frontend/modules/job/templates/newSuccess.php -->
    <?php use_stylesheet('job.css') ?>

    <h1>Post a Job</h1>

    <?php include_partial('form', array('form' => $form)) ?>

>**NOTE**
>If you have not added the `job` stylesheet yet, it is time to do so in both
>templates (`<?php use_stylesheet('job.css') ?>`).

The form itself is rendered in the `_form` ~partial|Partial Templates~. Replace
the content of the generated `_form` partial with the following code:

    [php]
    <!-- apps/frontend/modules/job/templates/_form.php -->
    <?php include_stylesheets_for_form($form) ?>
    <?php include_javascripts_for_form($form) ?>

    <?php echo form_tag_for($form, 'job') ?>
      <table id="job_form">
        <tfoot>
          <tr>
            <td colspan="2">
              <input type="submit" value="Preview your job" />
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tfoot>
        <tbody>
          <?php echo $form ?>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </form>

The `include_javascripts_for_form()` and `include_stylesheets_for_form()`
helpers include JavaScript and stylesheet dependencies needed for the form
widgets.

>**TIP**
>Even if the job form does not need any JavaScript or stylesheet file, it is a
>good habit to keep these helper calls "just in case". It can save your day
>later if you decide to change a widget that needs some ~JavaScript~ or a
>specific ~stylesheet|Stylesheets~.

The ~`form_tag_for()` helper~ generates a `<form>` ~tag|Forms (HTML)~ for the
given form and route and changes the ~HTTP methods|HTTP Method~ to ~`POST`|POST
(HTTP Method)~ or ~`PUT`|PUT (HTTP Method)~ depending on whether the object is
new or not. It also takes care of the ~`multipart|Forms (Multipart)`~ attribute
if the form has any file input tags.

Eventually, the `<?php echo $form ?>` renders the form widgets.

>**SIDEBAR**
>Customizing the Look and Feel of a Form
>
>By default, the `<?php echo $form ?>` renders the form widgets as table rows.
>
>Most of the time, you will need to customize the layout of your
>forms. The form object provides many useful methods for this 
> ~customization|Customization~:
>
> | Method                 | Description
> | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------
> | `render()`             | Renders the form (equivalent to the output of
> |                        | `echo $form`)
> | `renderHiddenFields()` | Renders the hidden fields
> | `hasErrors()`          | Returns `true` if the form has some errors
> | `hasGlobalErrors()`    | Returns `true` if the form has global errors
> | `getGlobalErrors()`    | Returns an array of global errors
> | `renderGlobalErrors()` | Renders the global errors
>
>The form also behaves like an array of fields. You can access the
>`company` field with `$form['company']`. The returned object provides methods
>to render each element of the field:

> | --------------- | ---------------------------------------
> | `renderRow()`   | Renders the field row
> | `render()`      | Renders the field widget
> | `renderLabel()` | Renders the field label
> | `renderError()` | Renders the field error messages if any
> | `renderHelp()`  | Renders the field help message
>
>The `echo $form` statement is equivalent to:
>
>     [php]
>     <?php foreach ($form as $widget): ?>
>       <?php echo $widget->renderRow() ?>
>     <?php endforeach ?>

### The Form Action

We now have a form class and a template that renders it. Now, it's time to
actually make it work with some ~action|Action~s.

The job form is managed by five methods in the `job` module:

  * **new**:         Displays a blank form to create a new job
  * **edit**:        Displays a form to edit an existing job
  * **create**:      Creates a new job with the user submitted values
  * **update**:      Updates an existing job with the user submitted values
  * **processForm**: Called by `create` and `update`, it processes the form
                     (validation, form repopulation, and serialization to
                     the database)

All forms have the following life-cycle:

![Form flow](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_4/10/form_flow.png)

As we have created a ##ORM## route collection 5 days sooner for the `job`
module, we can simplify the code for the form management methods:

    [php]
    // apps/frontend/modules/job/actions/actions.class.php
    public function executeNew(sfWebRequest $request)
    {
      $this->form = new JobeetJobForm();
    }

    public function executeCreate(sfWebRequest $request)
    {
      $this->form = new JobeetJobForm();
      $this->processForm($request, $this->form);
      $this->setTemplate('new');
    }

    public function executeEdit(sfWebRequest $request)
    {
      $this->form = new JobeetJobForm($this->getRoute()->getObject());
    }

    public function executeUpdate(sfWebRequest $request)
    {
      $this->form = new JobeetJobForm($this->getRoute()->getObject());
      $this->processForm($request, $this->form);
      $this->setTemplate('edit');
    }

    public function executeDelete(sfWebRequest $request)
    {
      $request->checkCSRFProtection();

      $job = $this->getRoute()->getObject();
      $job->delete();

      $this->redirect('job/index');
    }

    protected function processForm(sfWebRequest $request, sfForm $form)
    {
      $form->bind(
        $request->getParameter($form->getName()),
        $request->getFiles($form->getName())
      );

      if ($form->isValid())
      {
        $job = $form->save();

        $this->redirect('job_show', $job);
      }
    }

When you browse to the `/job/new` page, a new ~form|Forms~ instance is created
and passed to the template (`new` action).

When the user submits the form (`create` action), the form is bound (`bind()`
method) with the user submitted values and the validation is triggered.

Once the form is bound, it is possible to check its validity using the
`isValid()` method: If the form is valid (returns `true`), the job is saved to
the database (`$form->save()`), and the user is ~redirected|Redirection~ to the
job preview page; if not, the `newSuccess.php` template is displayed again with
the user submitted values and the associated error messages.

>**TIP**
>The `setTemplate()` method changes the ~template|Templates~ used for a given 
>action. If the submitted form is not valid, the `create` and `update` methods 
>use the same template as the `new` and `edit` action respectively to re-display 
>the form with error messages.

The modification of an existing job is quite similar. The only difference
between the `new` and the `edit` action is that the job object to be modified is
passed as the first argument of the form constructor. This object will be used
for default widget values in the template (default values are an object for
##ORM## forms, but a plain array for simple forms).

You can also define default values for the creation form. One way is to declare
the values in the database schema. Another one is to pass a pre-modified `Job`
object to the form constructor.

Change the `executeNew()` method to define `full-time` as the default value for
the `type` column:

    [php]
    // apps/frontend/modules/job/actions/actions.class.php
    public function executeNew(sfWebRequest $request)
    {
      $job = new JobeetJob();
      $job->setType('full-time');

      $this->form = new JobeetJobForm($job);
    }

### Protecting the Job Form with a Token

Everything must work fine by now. As of now, the user must enter the token for
the job. But the job token must be generated automatically when a new job is
created, as we don't want to rely on the user to provide a unique token.

Update the `save()` method of `JobeetJob` to add the logic that generates the
token before a new job is saved:

    [php]
<propel>
    // lib/model/JobeetJob.php
    public function save(PropelPDO $con = null)
</propel>
<doctrine>
    // lib/model/doctrine/JobeetJob.class.php
    public function save(Doctrine_Connection $conn = null)
</doctrine>
    {
      // ...

      if (!$this->getToken())
      {
        $this->setToken(sha1($this->getEmail().rand(11111, 99999)));
      }

<propel>
      return parent::save($con);
</propel>
<doctrine>
      return parent::save($conn);
</doctrine>
    }

You can now remove the `token` field from the form:

    [php]
<propel>
    // lib/form/JobeetJobForm.class.php
</propel>
<doctrine>
    // lib/form/doctrine/JobeetJobForm.class.php
</doctrine>
    class JobeetJobForm extends BaseJobeetJobForm
    {
      public function configure()
      {
        unset(
          $this['created_at'], $this['updated_at'],
          $this['expires_at'], $this['is_activated'],
          $this['token']
        );

        // ...
      }

      // ...
    }

If you remember the user stories from day 2, a job can be edited only if the
user knows the associated token. Right now, it is pretty easy to edit or delete
any job, just by guessing the URL. That's because the edit URL is like
`/job/ID/edit`, where `ID` is the ~primary key|Primary Key~ of the job.

By default, a ~`sfPropelRouteCollection`~ route generates URLs with the primary
key, but it can be changed to any unique column by passing the `column` option:

    [yml]
    # apps/frontend/config/~routing|Routing~.yml
    job:
      class:        sfPropelRouteCollection
      options:      { model: JobeetJob, column: token }
      requirements: { token: \w+ }

Notice that we have also changed the `token` parameter requirement to match any
string as the symfony default requirements is `\d+` for the unique key.

Now, all routes related to the jobs, except the `job_show_user` one, embed the
token. For instance, the route to edit a job is now of the following pattern:

    http://jobeet.localhost/job/TOKEN/edit

You will also need to change the "Edit" link in the `showSuccess` template:

    [php]
    <!-- apps/frontend/modules/job/templates/showSuccess.php -->
    <a href="<?php echo url_for('job_edit', $job) ?>">Edit</a>

The Preview Page
----------------

The preview page is the same as the job page display. Thanks to the
~routing|Routing~, if the user comes with the right token, it will be accessible
in the `token` request parameter.

If the user comes in with the tokenized URL, we will add an admin bar at the
top. At the beginning of the `showSuccess` template, add a partial to host the
admin bar and remove the `edit` link at the bottom:

    [php]
    <!-- apps/frontend/modules/job/templates/showSuccess.php -->
    <?php if ($sf_request->getParameter('token') == $job->getToken()): ?>
      <?php include_partial('job/admin', array('job' => $job)) ?>
    <?php endif ?>

Then, create the `_admin` partial:

    [php]
    <!-- apps/frontend/modules/job/templates/_admin.php -->
    <div id="job_actions">
      <h3>Admin</h3>
      <ul>
        <?php if (!$job->getIsActivated()): ?>
          <li><?php echo link_to('Edit', 'job_edit', $job) ?></li>
          <li><?php echo link_to('Publish', 'job_edit', $job) ?></li>
        <?php endif ?>
        <li><?php echo link_to('Delete', 'job_delete', $job, array('method' => 'delete', 'confirm' => 'Are you sure?')) ?></li>
        <?php if ($job->getIsActivated()): ?>
          <li<?php $job->expiresSoon() and print ' class="expires_soon"' ?>>
            <?php if ($job->isExpired()): ?>
              Expired
            <?php else: ?>
              Expires in <strong><?php echo $job->getDaysBeforeExpires() ?></strong> days
            <?php endif ?>

            <?php if ($job->expiresSoon()): ?>
             - <a href="">Extend</a> for another <?php echo sfConfig::get('app_active_days') ?> days
            <?php endif ?>
          </li>
        <?php else: ?>
          <li>
            [Bookmark this <?php echo link_to('URL', 'job_show', $job, true) ?> to manage this job in the future.]
          </li>
        <?php endif ?>
      </ul>
    </div>

There is a lot of code, but most of the code is simple to understand.

To make the template more readable, we have added a bunch of shortcut methods in
the `JobeetJob` class:

    [php]
<propel>
    // lib/model/JobeetJob.php
</propel>
<doctrine>
    // lib/model/doctrine/JobeetJob.class.php
</doctrine>
    public function getTypeName()
    {
<propel>
      return $this->getType() ? JobeetJobPeer::$types[$this->getType()] : '';
</propel>
<doctrine>
      $types = Doctrine_Core::getTable('JobeetJob')->getTypes();
      return $this->getType() ? $types[$this->getType()] : '';
</doctrine>
    }

    public function isExpired()
    {
      return $this->getDaysBeforeExpires() < 0;
    }

    public function expiresSoon()
    {
      return $this->getDaysBeforeExpires() < 5;
    }

    public function getDaysBeforeExpires()
    {
<propel>
      return ceil(($this->getExpiresAt('U') - time()) / 86400);
</propel>
<doctrine>
      return ceil(($this->getDateTimeObject('expires_at')->format('U') - time()) / 86400);
</doctrine>
    }

The admin bar displays the different actions depending on the job status:

![Not activated job](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_4/10/not_activated.png)

![Activated job](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_4/10/activated.png)

>**NOTE**
>You will be able to see the "activated" bar after the next section.

Job Activation and Publication
------------------------------

In the previous section, there is a link to publish the job. The link needs to
be changed to point to a new `publish` action. Instead of creating a new
~route|Route~, we can just configure the existing `job` route:

    [yml]
    # apps/frontend/config/routing.yml
    job:
      class:   sfPropelRouteCollection
      options:
        model:          JobeetJob
        column:         token
        object_actions: { publish: put }
      requirements:
        token: \w+

The `object_actions` takes an array of additional actions for the given object.
We can now change the link of the "Publish" link:

    [php]
    <!-- apps/frontend/modules/job/templates/_admin.php -->
    <li>
      <?php echo link_to('Publish', 'job_publish', $job, array('method' => 'put')) ?>
    </li>

The last step is to create the `publish` action:

    [php]
    // apps/frontend/modules/job/actions/actions.class.php
    public function executePublish(sfWebRequest $request)
    {
      $request->checkCSRFProtection();

      $job = $this->getRoute()->getObject();
      $job->publish();

      $this->getUser()->setFlash('notice', sprintf('Your job is now online for %s days.', sfConfig::get('app_active_days')));

      $this->redirect('job_show_user', $job);
    }

The astute reader will have noticed that the "Publish" link is submitted with
the HTTP put method. To simulate the put method, the link is automatically
converted to a form when you click on it.

And because we have enabled the ~CSRF~ protection, the `link_to()` helper embeds
a CSRF token in the link and the `checkCSRFProtection()` method of the request
object checks the validity of it on submission.

The `executePublish()` method uses a new `publish()` method that can be defined
as follows:

    [php]
<propel>
    // lib/model/JobeetJob.php
</propel>
<doctrine>
    // lib/model/doctrine/JobeetJob.class.php
</doctrine>
    public function publish()
    {
      $this->setIsActivated(true);
      $this->save();
    }

You can now test the new publish feature in your browser.

<propel>
But we still have something to fix. The non-activated jobs must not be
accessible, which means that they must not show up on the Jobeet homepage, and
must not be accessible by their URL. As we have created an
`addActiveJobsCriteria()` method to restrict a `Criteria` to active jobs, we can
just edit it and add the new requirements at the end:
</propel>
<doctrine>
But we still have something to fix. The non-activated jobs must not be
accessible, which means that they must not show up on the Jobeet homepage, and
must not be accessible by their URL. As we have created an
`addActiveJobsQuery()` method to restrict a `Doctrine_Query` to active jobs, we
can just edit it and add the new requirements at the end:
</doctrine>

<propel>
    [php]
    // lib/model/JobeetJobPeer.php
    static public function addActiveJobsCriteria(Criteria $criteria = null)
    {
      // ...

      $criteria->add(self::IS_ACTIVATED, true);

      return $criteria;
    }
</propel>
<doctrine>
    [php]
    // lib/model/doctrine/JobeetJobTable.class.php
    public function addActiveJobsQuery(Doctrine_Query $q = null)
    {
      // ...

      $q->andWhere($alias . '.is_activated = ?', 1);

      return $q;
    }
</doctrine>

That's all. You can test it now in your browser. All non-activated jobs have
disappeared from the homepage; even if you know their URLs, they are not
accessible anymore. They are, however, accessible if one knows the job's token
URL. In that case, the job preview will show up with the admin bar.

That's one of the great advantages of the MVC pattern and the refactorization we
have done along the way. Only a single change in one method was needed to add
the new requirement.

Final Thoughts
--------------

Today was packed with a lot of new information, but hopefully you now have a
better understanding of symfony's form framework.

We know that some of you noticed that we forgot something here... We have not
implemented any test for the new features. Because writing tests is an important
part of developing an application, this is the first thing we will do tomorrow.
