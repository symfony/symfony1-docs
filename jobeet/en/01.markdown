Day 1: Starting up the Project
==============================

Introduction
------------

The [symfony](http://www.symfony-project.org/) ~framework|Framework~ has been
an ~Open-Source~ project for more than four years and has become one of the
most popular PHP frameworks thanks to its great features and great
documentation.

This book describes the creation of a web application with the symfony
framework, step-by-step from the specifications to the implementation. It is
targeted at beginners who want to learn symfony, understand how it works, and
also learn about the best web development practices.

The application to be designed could have been yet another blog engine. But we
want to use symfony on a useful project. The goal is to demonstrate that
symfony can be used to develop professional applications with style and little
effort.

We will keep the content of the project secret for another day as we already
have much to do today. However, let's give it a name: **Jobeet**.

Each chapter of this book is meant to last between one and two hours, and will
be the occasion to learn symfony by coding a real website, from start to
finish. Every day, new features will be added to the application, and we'll
take advantage of this development to introduce you to new symfony
functionalities as well as good practices in symfony web development.

This Book is different
----------------------

Remember the early days of PHP4.
Ah, la [Belle Epoque](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belle_Époque)! PHP was one
of the first languages dedicated to the web and one of the easiest to learn.

But as web technologies evolve at a very fast pace, web developers need to keep
up with the latest best practices and tools. The best way to learn is of course
by reading blogs, tutorials, and books. We have read a lot of these, be they
written for PHP, Python, Java, Ruby, or Perl, and many of them fall short when
the author starts giving snippets of codes as examples.

You are probably used to reading warnings like:

  "For a real application, don't forget to add validation and proper error handling."

or

  "Security is left as an exercise to the reader."

or

  "You will of course need to write tests."

What? These things are serious business. They are perhaps the most important part
of any piece of code. And as a reader, you are left alone. Without these concerns
taken into account, the examples are much less useful. You cannot use them as
a good starting point. That's bad! Why? Because security, validation, error
handling, and tests, just to name a few, take care to code right.

In this book, you will never see statements like those as we will write tests,
error handling, validation code, and be sure we develop a secure application.
That's because symfony is about code, but also about best practices and how to
develop professional applications for the enterprise. We will be able to
afford this luxury because symfony provides all the tools needed to code these
aspects easily without writing too much code.

Validation, error handling, security, and tests are first-class citizens in
symfony, so it won't take us too long to explain. This is just one of many
reasons why to use a framework for "real life" projects.

All the code you will read in this book is code you could use for a real
project. We encourage you to copy and paste snippets of code or steal whole
chunks.

What for Today?
---------------

We won't write PHP code today. But even without writing a single line of code,
you will start understanding the benefits of using a framework like symfony,
just by bootstrapping a new project.

The objective of this chapter is to setup the development environment and
display a page of the application in a web browser. This includes installation
of symfony, creation of an application, and web server configuration.

As this book will mostly focus on the symfony framework, we will assume that
you already have a solid knowledge of PHP 5 and Object Oriented programming.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before installing symfony, you need to check that your computer has everything
installed and configured correctly. Take the time to conscientiously read this
chapter and follow all the steps required to check your configuration, as it
may save your day further down the road.

### Third-Party Software

First of all, you need to check that your computer has a friendly working
environment for web development. At a minimum, you need a web server (Apache,
for instance), a database engine (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or any
[PDO](http://www.php.net/PDO)-compatible database engine), and PHP 5.2.4 or
later.

### Command Line Interface

The symfony framework comes bundled with a command line tool that automates a
lot of work for you. If you are a Unix-like OS user, you will feel right at
home. If you run a Windows system, it will also work fine, but you will just
have to type a few commands at the `cmd` prompt.

>**Note**
>Unix shell commands can come in handy in a ~Windows~ environment.
>If you would like to use tools like `tar`, `gzip` or `grep` on Windows, you
>can install [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/).
>The adventurous may also like to try Microsoft's
>[Windows Services for Unix](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/interopmigration/bb380242.aspx).

### ~PHP Configuration~

As PHP configurations can vary a lot from one OS to another, or even between
different Linux distributions, you need to check that your PHP configuration
meets the symfony minimum requirements.

First, ensure that you have PHP 5.2.4 at a minimum installed by using the
`phpinfo()` built-in function or by running `php -v` on the command line. Be
aware that on some configurations, you might have two different PHP versions
installed: one for the command line, and another for the web.

Then, download the symfony configuration checker script at the following URL:

    http://sf-to.org/1.4/check.php

Save the script somewhere under your current web root directory.

Launch the configuration checker script from the command line:

    $ php check_configuration.php

If there is a problem with your PHP configuration, the output of the command
will give you hints on what to fix and how to fix it.

You should also execute the checker from a browser and fix the issues it might
discover. That's because PHP can have a distinct `php.ini` configuration file
for these two environments, with different settings.

>**NOTE**
>Don't forget to remove the file from your web root directory
>afterwards.

Symfony ~Installation~
----------------------

### Initializing the Project Directory

Before installing symfony, you first need to create a directory that will host
all the files related to Jobeet:

    $ mkdir -p /home/sfprojects/jobeet
    $ cd /home/sfprojects/jobeet

Or on Windows:

    c:\> mkdir c:\development\sfprojects\jobeet
    c:\> cd c:\development\sfprojects\jobeet

>**NOTE**
>Windows users are advised to run symfony and to setup their new
>project in a path which contains no spaces.
>Avoid using the `Documents and Settings` directory, including anywhere
>under `My Documents`.

-

>**TIP**
>If you create the symfony project directory under the web root
>directory, you won't need to configure your web server.  Of course, for
>production environments, we strongly advise you to configure your web
>server as explained in the web server configuration section.

### Choosing the Symfony Version

Now, you need to install symfony. As the symfony framework has several stable
versions, you need to choose the one you want to install by reading the
[installation page](http://www.symfony-project.org/installation) on the
symfony website.

This book assumes you want to install symfony 1.3 or symfony 1.4.

### Choosing the Symfony Installation Location

You can install symfony globally on your machine, or embed it into each of
your project. The latter is the recommended one as projects will then be
totally independent from each others. Upgrading your locally installed symfony
won't break some of your projects unexpectedly. It means you will be able to
have projects on different versions of symfony, and upgrade them one at a time
as you see fit.

As a best practice, many people install the symfony framework files in the
`lib/vendor` project directory. So, first, create this directory:

    $ mkdir -p lib/vendor

### Installing Symfony

#### Installing from an Archive

The easiest way to install symfony is to download the archive for the version
you choose from the symfony website. Go to the installation page for the
version you have just chosen, symfony
[1.4](http://www.symfony-project.org/installation/1_4) for instance.

Under the "**Source Download**" section, you will find the archive in `.tgz`
or in `.zip` format. Download the archive, put it under the freshly created
`lib/vendor/` directory, un-archive it, and rename the directory to `symfony`:

    $ cd lib/vendor
    $ tar zxpf symfony-1.4.0.tgz
    $ mv symfony-1.4.0 symfony
    $ rm symfony-1.4.0.tgz

Under Windows, unzipping the zip file can be achieved using Windows Explorer.
After you rename the directory to `symfony`, there should be a directory
structure similar to `c:\dev\sfprojects\jobeet\lib\vendor\symfony`.

#### Installing from Subversion (recommended)

If you use Subversion, it is even better to use the `svn:externals` property
to embed symfony into your project in the `lib/vendor/` directory:

    $ svn pe svn:externals lib/vendor/

>**NOTE**
>Importing your project in a new Subversion repository is explained at the end
>of this chapter.

If everything goes well, this command will run your favorite editor to give
you the opportunity to configure the external Subversion sources.

>**TIP**
>On Windows, you can use tools like [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.net/)
>to do everything without the need to use the console.

If you are conservative, tie your project to a specific release (a subversion
tag):

    symfony http://svn.symfony-project.com/tags/RELEASE_1_4_0

Whenever a new release comes out (as announced on the symfony
[blog](http://www.symfony-project.org/blog/)), you will need to change the URL
to the new version.

If you want to go the bleeding-edge route, use the 1.4 branch:

    symfony http://svn.symfony-project.com/branches/1.4/

Using the branch makes your project benefits from the bug fixes automatically
whenever you run a `svn update`.

#### Installation Verification

Now that symfony is installed, check that everything is working by using the
symfony command line to display the symfony version (note the capital `V`):

    $ cd ../..
    $ php lib/vendor/symfony/data/bin/symfony -V

On Windows:

    c:\> cd ..\..
    c:\> php lib\vendor\symfony\data\bin\symfony -V

>**TIP**
>If you are curious about what this command line tool can do for you, type
>`symfony` to list the available options and tasks:
>
>     $ php lib/vendor/symfony/data/bin/symfony
>
>On Windows:
>
>     c:\> php lib\vendor\symfony\data\bin\symfony
>
>The symfony command line is the developer's best friend. It provides a lot of
>utilities that improve your productivity for day-to-day activities like
>cleaning the cache, generating code, and much more.

Project Setup
-------------

In symfony, **~applications|Applications~** sharing the same data model are
regrouped into **~projects|Projects~**. For most projects, you will have two
different applications: a ~frontend|Frontend~ and a ~backend|Backend~.

### Project Creation

From the `sfprojects/jobeet` directory, run the symfony `generate:project`
task to actually create the symfony project:

<doctrine>
    $ php lib/vendor/symfony/data/bin/symfony generate:project jobeet
</doctrine>
<propel>
    $ php lib/vendor/symfony/data/bin/symfony generate:project jobeet --orm=Propel
</propel>

On Windows:

<doctrine>
    c:\> php lib\vendor\symfony\data\bin\symfony generate:project jobeet
</doctrine>
<propel>
    c:\> php lib\vendor\symfony\data\bin\symfony generate:project jobeet --orm=Propel
</propel>

The `generate:project` task generates the default structure of directories and
files needed for a symfony project:

 | Directory   | Description
 | ----------- | ----------------------------------
 | `apps/`     | Hosts all project applications
 | `cache/`    | The files cached by the framework
 | `config/`   | The project configuration files
 | `lib/`      | The project libraries and classes
 | `log/`      | The framework log files
 | `plugins/`  | The installed plugins
 | `test/`     | The unit and functional test files
 | `web/`      | The web root directory (see below)

>**NOTE**
>Why does symfony generate so many files? One of the main benefits of using
>a full-stack framework is to standardize your developments. Thanks to
>symfony's default structure of files and directories, any developer with
>some symfony knowledge can take over the maintenance of any symfony project.
>In a matter of minutes, he will be able to dive into the code, fix bugs,
>and add new features.

The `generate:project` task has also created a `symfony` shortcut in the
project root directory to shorten the number of characters you have to write
when running a task.

So, from now on, instead of using the fully qualified path to the symfony
program, you can use the `symfony` shortcut.

### Application Creation

Now, create the frontend application by running the `generate:app` task:

    $ php symfony generate:app frontend

>**TIP**
>Because the symfony shortcut file is executable, Unix users can replace all
>occurrences of '`php symfony`' by '`./symfony`' from now on.
>
>On Windows you can copy the '`symfony.bat`' file to your project and use
>'`symfony`' instead of '`php symfony`':
>
>     c:\> copy lib\vendor\symfony\data\bin\symfony.bat .

Based on the application name given as an *argument*, the `generate:app` task
creates the default directory structure needed for the application under the
`apps/frontend/` directory:

 | Directory    | Description
 | ------------ | -------------------------------------
 | `config/`    | The application configuration files
 | `lib/`       | The application libraries and classes
 | `modules/`   | The application code (MVC)
 | `templates/` | The global template files

>**SIDEBAR**
>Security
>
>By default, the `generate:app` task has secured our application from the two
>most widespread vulnerabilities found on the web. That's right, symfony
>automatically takes ~security|Security~ measures on our behalf.
>
>To prevent ~XSS~ attacks, output escaping has been enabled; and to prevent
>~CSRF~ attacks, a random CSRF secret has been generated.
>
>Of course, you can tweak these settings thanks to the following *options*:
>
>  * `--escaping-strategy`: Enables or disables output escaping
>  * `--csrf-secret`: Enables session tokens in forms
>
>If you know nothing about
>[XSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) or
>[CSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSRF), take the time to learn more these
>security vulnerabilities.

### Directory Structure Rights

Before trying to access your newly created project, you need to set the write
permissions on the `cache/` and `log/` directories to the appropriate levels,
so that your web server can write to them:

    $ chmod 777 cache/ log/

>**SIDEBAR**
>Tips for People using a SCM Tool
>
>symfony only ever writes in two directories of a symfony project,
>`cache/` and `log/`. The content of these directories should be ignored
>by your SCM (by editing the `svn:ignore` property if you use Subversion
>for instance).

~Web Server~ Configuration: The ugly Way
----------------------------------------

If you have created the project directory it somewhere under the web root
directory of your web server, you can already access the project in a web
browser.

Of course, as there is no configuration, it is very fast to set up, but try to
access the `config/databases.yml` file in your browser to understand the bad
consequences of such a lazy attitude. If the user knows that your website is
developed with symfony, he will have access to a lot of sensitive files.

**Never ever use this setup on a production server**, and read the next
section to learn how to configure your web server properly.

Web Server Configuration: The secure Way
----------------------------------------

A good web practice is to put under the web root directory only the files that
need to be accessed by a web browser, like stylesheets, JavaScripts and
images. By default, we recommend to store these files under the `web/`
sub-directory of a symfony project.

If you have a look at this directory, you will find some sub-directories for
web ~assets|Assets~ (`css/` and `images/`) and the two front controller files.
The front controllers are the only PHP files that need to be under the web
root directory. All other PHP files can be hidden from the browser, which is a
good idea as far as ~security|Security~ is concerned.

### Web Server Configuration

Now it is time to change your ~Apache~ configuration, to make the new project
accessible to the world.

Locate and open the `httpd.conf` configuration file and add the following
configuration at the end:

    # Be sure to only have this line once in your configuration
    NameVirtualHost 127.0.0.1:8080

    # This is the configuration for your project
    Listen 127.0.0.1:8080

    <VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:8080>
      DocumentRoot "/home/sfprojects/jobeet/web"
      DirectoryIndex index.php
      <Directory "/home/sfprojects/jobeet/web">
        AllowOverride All
        Allow from All
      </Directory>

      Alias /sf /home/sfprojects/jobeet/lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf
      <Directory "/home/sfprojects/jobeet/lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf">
        AllowOverride All
        Allow from All
      </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>

>**NOTE**
>The `/sf` ~alias|Alias (Apache)~ gives you access to images and javascript files needed
>to properly display ~default symfony pages|Default symfony Pages~ and the ~web debug toolbar~|Web Debug Toolbar.
>
>On ~Windows~, you need to replace the `Alias` line with something like:
>
>     Alias /sf "c:\dev\sfprojects\jobeet\lib\vendor\symfony\data\web\sf"
>
>And `/home/sfprojects/jobeet/web` should be replaced with:
>
>     c:\dev\sfprojects\jobeet\web

This configuration makes Apache listen to port `8080` on your machine, so
the website will be accessible at the following URL:

    http://~localhost~:8080/

You can change `8080` to any number, but favour numbers greater than `1024` as
they do not require administrator rights.

>**SIDEBAR**
>Configure a dedicated ~Domain Name~
>
>If you are an administrator on your machine, it is better to setup
>~virtual hosts|Virtual Host~ instead of adding a new port each time you start a new
>project. Instead of choosing a port and add a `Listen` statement,
>choose a domain name (for instance the real domain name with
>`.localhost` added at the end) and add a `ServerName` statement:
>
>     # This is the configuration for your project
>     <VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80>
>       ServerName www.jobeet.com.localhost
>       <!-- same configuration as before -->
>     </VirtualHost>
>
>The domain name `www.jobeet.com.localhost` used in the Apache configuration
>has to be declared locally. If you run a Linux system, it has to be
>done in the `/etc/hosts` file. If you run Windows XP, this file is
>located in the `C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\` directory.
>
>Add in the following line:
>
>     127.0.0.1 www.jobeet.com.localhost

### Test the New Configuration

Restart Apache, and check that you now have access to the new application by
opening a browser and typing `http://localhost:8080/index.php/`, or
`http://www.jobeet.com.localhost/index.php/` depending on the Apache configuration
you chose in the previous section.

![Congratulations](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_4/01/congratulations.png)

>**TIP**
>If you have the Apache `mod_rewrite` module installed, you can remove
>the `index.php/` part of the URL. This is possible thanks to the
>rewriting rules configured in the `web/.htaccess` file.

You should also try to access the application in the development environment
(see the next section for more information about environments). Type in the
following URL:

    http://www.jobeet.com.localhost/frontend_dev.php/

The web debug toolbar should show in the top right corner, including small
icons proving that your `sf/` alias configuration is correct.

![web debug toolbar](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_4/01/web_debug_toolbar.png)

>**Note**
>The setup is a little different if you want to run symfony on an IIS server in
>a Windows environment. Find how to configure it in the
>[related tutorial](http://www.symfony-project.com/cookbook/1_0/web_server_iis).

The ~Environments~
------------------

If you have a look at the `web/` directory, you will find two PHP files:
`index.php` and `frontend_dev.php`. These files are called **front
controllers**; all requests to the application are made through them. But why
do we have two ~front controllers|Front Controller~ for each application?

Both files point to the same application but for different **environments**.
When you develop an application, except if you develop directly on the
production server, you need several environments:

  * The **development environment**: This is the environment used by **web
    developers** when they work on the application to add new features, fix
    bugs, ...

  * The **test environment**: This environment is used to automatically test
    the application.

  * The **staging environment**: This environment is used by the **customer**
    to test the application and report bugs or missing features.

  * The **production environment**: This is the environment **end users**
    interact with.

What makes an environment unique? In the development environment for instance,
the application needs to log all the details of a request to ease debugging,
but the cache system must be disabled as all changes made to the code must be
taken into account right away. So, the development environment must be
optimized for the developer. The best example is certainly when an
~exception|Exception Handling~ occurs. To help the developer debug the issue
faster, symfony displays the exception with all the information it has about
the current request right into the browser:

![An exception in the dev environment](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_4/01/exception_dev.png)

But on the production environment, the cache layer must be activated and, of
course, the application must display customized error messages instead of raw
exceptions. So, the production environment must be optimized for performance
and the user experience.

![An exception in the prod environment](http://www.symfony-project.org/images/jobeet/1_4/01/exception_prod.png)

>**TIP**
>If you open the front controller files, you will see that their content is
>the same except for the environment setting:
>
>     [php]
>     // web/index.php
>     <?php
>
>     require_once(dirname(__FILE__).'/../config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php');
>
>     $configuration = ProjectConfiguration::getApplicationConfiguration('frontend', 'prod', false);
>     sfContext::createInstance($configuration)->dispatch();

The web debug toolbar is also a great example of the usage of environment. It
is present on all pages in the development environment and gives you access to
a lot of information by clicking on the different tabs: the current
application configuration, the logs for the current request, the SQL
statements executed on the database engine, memory information, and time
information.

~Subversion~
------------

It is a good practice to use source version control when developing a web
application. Using a source version control allows us to:

 * work with confidence
 * revert to a previous version if a change breaks something
 * allow more than one person to work efficiently on the project
 * have access to all the successive versions of the application

In this section, we will describe how to use
[Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) with symfony. If you use another
source code control tool, it must be quite easy to adapt what we describe for
Subversion.

We assume you have already access to a Subversion server and can access it via
HTTP.

>**TIP**
>If you don't have a Subversion server at your disposal, you can create a
>repository for free on [Google Code](http://code.google.com/hosting/) or
>just type "free subversion repository" in Google to have a lot more options.

First, create a repository for the `jobeet` project on the repository server:

    $ svnadmin create /path/to/jobeet/repository

On your machine, create the basic directory structure:

    $ svn mkdir -m "created default directory structure"
    ➥ http://svn.example.com/jobeet/trunk
    ➥ http://svn.example.com/jobeet/tags
    ➥ http://svn.example.com/jobeet/branches

And checkout the empty `trunk/` directory:

    $ cd /home/sfprojects/jobeet
    $ svn co http://svn.example.com/jobeet/trunk/ .

Then, remove the content of the `cache/` and `log/` directories as we don't
want to put them into the repository.

    $ rm -rf cache/* log/*

Now, make sure to set the write permissions on the cache and logs directories
to the appropriate levels so that your web server can write to them:

    $ chmod 777 cache/ log/

Now, import all the files and directories:

    $ svn add *

As we will never want to commit files located in the `cache/` and `log/`
directories, you need to specify an ignore list:

    $ svn propedit svn:ignore cache

The default text editor configured for SVN should launch. Subversion must
ignore all the content of this directory:

    *

Save and quit. You're done.

Repeat the procedure for the `log/` directory:

    $ svn propedit svn:ignore log

And enter:

    *

Finally, commit these changes to the repository:

    $ svn import -m "made the initial import" .
      ➥ http://svn.example.com/jobeet/trunk

>**Tip**
>~Windows~ users can use the great [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/)
client to manage their subversion repository.

See you Tomorrow
----------------

Well, time is over for today! Even if we have not yet started talking about
symfony, we have setup a solid development environment, we have talked about web
development best practices, and we are ready to start coding.

Tomorrow, we will reveal what the application will do and talk about the
requirements we need to implement for Jobeet.
